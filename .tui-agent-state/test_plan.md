# Fresh TUI Editor — Test Plan

> **Process:** Read `AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` first. Filing standards, the
> pre-testing checklist, and the anti-drift rules (R1–R4) live there. In
> particular: **R1 — do not re-verify `[x]` sprints; R2 — advance a `[ ]` item
> every run.** Sprints 1–9 are DONE; work the priority order below, not them.

  - PASS: Status shows "Local | [filename] | Ln X, Col Y | [message] | encoding | filetype | hint"
- [x] **T05** — Verify title bar / window title updates with open file
  - PASS: Tab title updates with filename; asterisk (*) indicates unsaved changes

- [x] **T11** — Save As; verify prompts for new filename

- [x] **T23** — Navigate matches with F3; verify cursor jumps with "Match N of M"
  - PASS: F3 = next match, Shift+F3 = prev. Status shows "Match N of M". Wrap-around works.

  - PASS (Run #13): Command "Go to Matching Bracket" (Ctrl+]) works via command palette. '(' → ')' and '{' → '}' jumps confirmed. NOTE: Ctrl+] via tmux send-keys is unreliable (Ctrl+] = 0x1D, may not transmit correctly in tmux). Use command palette instead.
- [x] **T29** — Word movement (Ctrl+Left/Right); verify word-by-word nav
  - PASS: Ctrl+Right jumps to end of each word/token
- [x] **T30** — Position history (Alt+Left/Right); verify back/forward nav
  - PASS (Run #13): Alt+Left goes back in position history; Alt+Right goes forward. Tested with Ctrl+G jumps building history.

  - PASS (Run #13): 49MB / 500K line file opened instantly. Navigation to end: immediate. Search "499999" found 2 matches in <2s. Gutter shows BYTE OFFSETS (not line numbers) for large files — Fresh's virtual view mode.
- [x] **T46** — Open a binary file; verify graceful handling
  - PASS (Run #13): /bin/ls opened gracefully. Tab shows [BIN] tag. Non-printable bytes shown as <XX> hex notation. No crash/freeze.
- [x] **T47** — Rapid keystrokes; verify no dropped input
  - PASS (Run #14): 50 rapid chars → all intact; 20 rapid Ctrl+Z → all undone correctly. No dropped input, no corruption.
- [x] **T48** — Resize tmux window while editing; verify layout reflow
  - PASS (Run #14): Resize 220×50 → 80×24 → 180×40 all reflow correctly. Status bar truncates gracefully at narrow width. Editor remains responsive. Resize mid-typing (100×30 → 160×45 during text entry) produced no corruption.

- [x] ***Keyboard Shortcuts* 'q' recheck** — STILL BROKEN. "Editing disabled in this buffer" (#2125 related, still open)

## Sprint 13: Alt+A + Calibrate Keyboard + Bug Rechecks — COMPLETED (Run #14)
- [x] **T47** — PASS: Rapid keystrokes, no dropped input (50 chars burst, 20 rapid undos)
- [x] **T48** — PASS: Resize reflow works (220×50 ↔ 80×24 ↔ 180×40; mid-type resize safe)
- [x] **Alt+A** — PASS: Project-wide Search & Replace works: 9 matches/4 files, file scoping via Space, Replace All with confirmation dialog, status "Replaced 3 occurrences in 1 files"
- [x] **Calibrate Keyboard wizard** — TESTED: 24 steps/5 groups (Basic Editing, Line Navigation, Word Navigation, Document Navigation, Emacs-Style). Does NOT test Ctrl+H. s/b/g/a controls all work.
- [x] **#2125 partial** — Diagnostics panel 'q' CONFIRMED FIXED (commit 89caf72). *Keyboard Shortcuts* 'q' STILL BROKEN.
- [x] **#2112** — CONFIRMED FIXED (commit b7e7e64). Search/Replace panel now finds matches in /tmp files outside workspace root.

## Sprint 12: Bug Verification — COMPLETED (Run #13)
- [x] **TB01** — CONFIRMED: Keyboard Shortcuts buffer 'q' does not close
  - Same root cause as #2125 (Diagnostics panel). Comment added to #2125. Do NOT re-file.
- [x] **TB02** — CONFIRMED: Edit menu "Replace..." maps to Ctrl+Alt+R = Query Replace (interactive), not basic Replace (Ctrl+R)
  - Filed as new issue #2135. Do NOT re-file.
- [x] **TB03** — RESOLVED (NOT A BUG): Alt+W correctly closes tab in normal editing mode. Status shows "Tab closed".
  - Context-sensitive: Alt+W in search bar = toggle whole word; outside search = close tab. Expected behavior.
