# Fresh Editor — TUI Agent Knowledge Base

## ⚠️ FALSE POSITIVE PATTERNS — READ BEFORE TESTING

The following things look like bugs but are NOT. Run #1 wasted time on all of these.
Check this list before filing any issue.

| Observation | What it actually is |
|-------------|---------------------|
| File opens with `[+]` / asterisk and unread content on fresh launch | **Hot exit.** Fresh restores all unsaved buffers on startup. `hot_exit` is on by default. Use `fresh --no-restore` if you need a clean slate. |
| `Ctrl+W` selects a word instead of closing the tab | **Intentional.** Fresh's `Ctrl+W` = Select word. VS Code's `Ctrl+W` = Close tab. Use command palette → "Close Buffer" to close. |
| `Ctrl+H` deletes a word instead of opening Find & Replace | **Terminal compatibility.** `Ctrl+H` = Find & Replace is intended and documented, but terminals transmit it as ASCII `0x08` = Backspace. Use `Ctrl+R` for reliable Replace. |
| Menu arrow-key navigation appears unresponsive | **Highlight is subtle.** Selection uses `[48;5;25m]` (dark blue). Use `tmux capture-pane -e` (ANSI mode) to verify which item is active — plain `-p` hides it. |
| `File > Revert` triggers "Cannot reload: buffer has unsaved modifications" | **You triggered the wrong menu item.** That error comes from "Reload with Encoding...". `File > Revert` correctly shows a `(r)evert/(c)ancel` confirmation prompt. Verify selection with ANSI capture. |
| `[No Name]*` buffer appears on launch | **Hot exit** restored an unnamed scratch buffer from a previous session. |
| "Split Vertical" command produces stacked (horizontal) panes | **Naming convention.** Fresh's "vertical" refers to the split line direction. Stacked panes = horizontal divider. Not a bug. |
| Arrow keys don't move cursor / navigation seems broken | **DECCKM terminal mode.** Fresh uses application cursor key mode. Must send `$'\033O[A-D]'` NOT tmux `Up`/`Down` key names. See tmux automation section below. |
| `DC` tmux key name doesn't delete forward | **Wrong escape.** Use `$'\033[3~'` for the Delete key in Fresh. |
| Search/Replace panel shows "No matches found" for open file | **Workspace scoping bug (#2112).** The search backend only searches within the git project root. Files from /tmp or outside the workspace fail silently. |
| Shift+F3 does not navigate to previous match | **Terminal compatibility.** `S-F3` in tmux does not send the correct shift+F3 escape. "Find Previous" works via command palette (binding: `Ctrl+Shift+N`, but also problematic in tmux). |
| `Ctrl+Tab` doesn't switch tabs — types Tab character into buffer | **Wrong key.** Tab switching is `Ctrl+PgDn` / `Ctrl+PgUp` (tmux: `C-NPage` / `C-PPage`). Never use `Ctrl+Tab` in tmux. |
| File Explorer arrow keys do nothing after Ctrl+B | **Focus not on explorer.** `Ctrl+B` opens the sidebar but does NOT focus it. Use `Ctrl+E` to give focus to the explorer. Status bar shows "File explorer focused". |
| "Toggle Line Wrap" not found in command palette | **It's in the menu, not the palette.** Toggle Line Wrap is in View menu (`Alt+V` → navigate down 2 from File Explorer to `☑ Line Wrap`). |
| Close buffer prompt requires Enter after the letter key | **Confirmed in Run #3.** When the close-buffer prompt appears as a bottom-line input, you must type the letter (e.g. `d`) AND press Enter to confirm. Just pressing `d` appends to the prompt text. |
| Settings checkboxes not navigable via Tab | **Run #6 concern RESOLVED in Run #7.** Checkboxes ARE reachable: use ↑↓ arrows (DECCKM) in the right panel to navigate to a checkbox, then Enter to toggle. Tab only reaches number/text inputs. |
| "move_to_paragraph" not found in command palette | **By design** (PR #2084): movement-only actions don't get palette entries, same as `move_left`. BUT missing default keybinding is a bug (#2122). These actions exist but require manual keybinding configuration. |
| "Next Window" command shows "Cancelled" | **Single-window behavior** — correct when only 1 window open. Requires Orchestrator-created multi-window sessions to have multiple windows to cycle. |

## Application Overview
- **Name:** Fresh — a modern terminal text editor
- **Version:** 0.3.9 (as of Run #7)
- **Binary:** `./target/release/fresh`
- **Build:** `cargo build --release --bin fresh`

---

## MANDATORY PRE-TESTING CHECKLIST
Before filing any bug, the agent MUST:
1. Check `docs/features/` for feature documentation
2. Check `docs/blog/` for release notes (features that look like bugs are often documented)
3. Check `docs/configuration/keyboard.md` for the actual keybinding table
4. Verify menu navigation with `tmux capture-pane -p -e` (ANSI) to confirm the highlighted item
5. Check `CHANGELOG.md` for the relevant version's feature list

---

## ISSUE FILING STANDARDS

### When to open an issue

Open an issue only when you can answer ALL of the following:
- **What is the exact expected behavior?** (cite a reference: VS Code, Sublime, browser, or Fresh's own docs)
- **What is the exact actual behavior?** (observed directly, reproducible)
- **Would a reasonable user be confused or blocked by this?**

Do NOT open an issue when:
- You haven't finished testing ("needs re-test", "not yet verified")
- You're unsure if the behavior is intentional — check docs first, then decide
- You can only describe the symptom but not the expected vs actual contrast

If you observe something suspicious but haven't confirmed it yet, note it in `test_plan.md` as a pending test case. File the issue only after you have clear evidence.

### Two valid issue types

**1. Bug** — behavior is broken or incorrect per Fresh's own documentation
- Example: A documented shortcut does nothing, a save dialog corrupts the file, a crash

**2. Usability issue** — behavior works but contradicts what users coming from VS Code/Sublime/browsers will expect
- Example: F3 silently ignored while search bar is open (#2111), Ctrl+H transmits as Backspace (#2109)
- These are still valid issues. "It's documented" does not mean "users won't be confused."
- Label these as `bug` since they represent a user experience failure

**Not a valid issue:**
- Behavior that matches Fresh's documentation AND matches common editor conventions
- Something you observed once and couldn't reproduce
- Something listed in the FALSE POSITIVE PATTERNS table above

### Required issue structure

Every issue MUST contain all four of these sections. If you can't fill them all in, finish testing first.

```
## Steps to reproduce
1. [exact, numbered steps starting from a clean state]
2. ...

## Expected behavior
[What a user coming from VS Code/Sublime/browser would expect — be specific.
If citing a reference editor, name it: "In VS Code, F3 advances to the next
match without closing the search bar."]

## Actual behavior
[What Fresh actually does — be specific. "Nothing happens" is not enough;
say "The cursor does not move. The search bar remains open but no navigation occurs."]

## Workaround
[If one exists. If none, say "None."]
```

### Issue title rules

- State the problem, not the investigation: **"F3 does not navigate while search bar is open"** not ~~"Search F3 navigation not verified"~~
- Use present tense: **"F3 does not..."** not ~~"F3 didn't..."~~
- Name the specific feature or key: **"Ctrl+H opens backspace instead of Find & Replace"** not ~~"Keyboard shortcut issue"~~
- Never use words like "maybe", "possibly", "needs confirmation", or "not verified" in a title — if you're not sure, don't file yet

### Before filing: search check

Search GitHub with at least 3 query variations. Use: the key name, the symptom, the feature name.
Log your search queries in the issue body so future runs don't repeat the same searches.

## Settings UI Navigation (Run #6 — CRITICAL)

### Navigation Model
The Settings UI has a complex two-panel navigation:
- **Left panel** (category tree): Uses ↑↓ DECCKM arrows. Collapsed categories (`▶`) skip all children on Down. Expand with Right arrow (`→`), collapse with Left (`←`). 
- **Right panel** (settings content): Scrollable. Automatically scrolls to show the selected section when you select it in the left panel AND press Enter.
- **Tab**: Navigates to the next FOCUSABLE widget in the right panel. Only NUMBER FIELDS and TEXT INPUTS are focusable via Tab. CHECKBOXES ARE NOT tab-navigable (confirmed in Run #6).
- **To enter a section**: Left panel → navigate to section → Enter → right panel scrolls to that section
- **To reach a setting**: Left panel → correct section → Enter → Tab to first number/text field → navigate from there

### Step-by-Step: Reach Auto Save Enabled checkbox
The checkbox `Auto Save Enabled: [ ]` is in Settings > Editor (expanded with →) > Recovery.
Currently, the ONLY confirmed working method is:
1. Edit `/root/.config/fresh/config.json` directly: add `"editor": {"auto_save_enabled": true}`
2. Restart Fresh to pick up the config change
3. Verify in Settings UI that `Auto Save Enabled: [v]` is now checked

### Category Navigation Order (Editor expanded)
From Editor (expanded), Down navigates:
1. Bracket Matching
2. Completion  
3. Diagnostics
4. Display
5. Editing
6. Keyboard
7. LSP
8. Mouse
9. Performance
10. Recovery ← contains: auto_recovery_interval, auto_revert_poll, **auto_save_enabled**, auto_save_interval, recovery_enabled
11. Startup
12. Status Bar
13. Whitespace

### Reaching Recovery
1. Navigate: ↑↓ to `▶ Editor` → Right to expand → Down × 10 to `Recovery`
2. Press Enter → right panel scrolls to Recovery content
3. Tab → first focusable item (Auto Recovery Save Interval Secs)
4. Tab again → jumps to `[ User ]` footer button (bypassing checkboxes)

## tmux Automation Notes (CRITICAL — Run #2 Discovery)

### Arrow Keys MUST Use DECCKM Sequences
Fresh operates in DECCKM (application cursor key mode). Standard VT100 arrow sequences are **silently ignored**.

```bash
# CORRECT — DECCKM application sequences
tmux send-keys -t SESSION $'\033OA'   # Up
tmux send-keys -t SESSION $'\033OB'   # Down
tmux send-keys -t SESSION $'\033OC'   # Right
tmux send-keys -t SESSION $'\033OD'   # Left

# WRONG — VT100 sequences (ignored by Fresh)
tmux send-keys -t SESSION Up
tmux send-keys -t SESSION Down
tmux send-keys -t SESSION $'\033[A'   # Also ignored
```

### Delete Key
```bash
tmux send-keys -t SESSION $'\033[3~'   # CORRECT — forward delete
# NOT: tmux send-keys -t SESSION DC    # DC key name is NOT forwarded correctly
```

### Keyboard Timing
- Allow 200-300ms between key sends: `sleep 0.3`
- Allow 1-2s for panel operations (search, replace): `sleep 2`
- Multi-key sequences (multiple BSpace): add delay between each: `sleep 0.1` per key

### Command Palette Mode Switching
The palette opens with `>` (command mode). To switch modes:
- BSpace to remove `>` → file/fuzzy-finder mode (shows project files)
- Type `:` → line mode
- Type `#` → buffer mode
- Ctrl+U does NOT clear the input (sends literal in editor instead)
- Use multiple BSpace presses with delays; watch for input leak bug (#2113)

---

## Features That Look Like Bugs Added in Run #6

| Observation | What it actually is |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Settings checkboxes not reachable via Tab | **UNCONFIRMED** — Tab navigates to number/text inputs + footer buttons; checkboxes appear to be skipped. May require mouse. PENDING investigation. |
| "Tour ended" status message after Exit Tour | **By design** — Confirms the tour was successfully closed. |
| Orchestrator New Session: Enter closes dialog without creating session | **Focus issue** — Enter may toggle the "Create worktree" checkbox if that's focused. Must Tab×6 to reach "Create Session" button. |
| Settings UI: "Enter" on a search result navigates to the SECTION, not the setting | **By design** — Enter scrolls right panel to show the section containing the setting, then you must Tab to interact with individual settings. |
| Review Diff UNSTAGED shows +1/-1 for same content after staging | **Likely line-ending normalization** — git staging may normalize line endings, creating a minor diff. NOT a bug; verify with git diff on the staged content. |

## Features That Look Like Bugs Added in Run #5

| Observation | What it actually is |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Review Diff: "Discard hunk" fails with "Patch failed: error: patch failed..." | **Real bug #2117** — NOT by design. File `git apply --reverse` works fine from shell; Fresh's internal patch application is broken. |
| Alt+Q doesn't open Orchestrator in tmux | **tmux interference** — Alt+Q might not be forwarded correctly by tmux. Use `Ctrl+P → "Orchestrator: Open"` instead. |
| Theme Editor left panel shows `*tree* [RO]` with "Editing disabled" | **By design** — the tree panel is read-only; Tab to switch to the right editing panel to actually change a color value. |
| Review Diff palette shows "Git Blame: Close" before "Git Blame" | **Palette ordering** — sub-commands appear below the main command in fuzzy-match results. Always navigate UP multiple times to find the main "Git Blame" command. |

---

## Features That Look Like Bugs (ARE BY DESIGN)

### Hot Exit (session persistence)
- **What:** All buffers — including unnamed scratch and dirty files — are automatically saved on quit and restored on next launch.
- **Why it looks like a bug:** Files reopen with `[+]`/asterisk even though content matches disk. An extra `[No Name]*` buffer may appear.
- **It's correct behavior.** Config: `hot_exit` (default: on). Docs: `docs/features/session-persistence.md`.
- **UX note to file separately:** Consider showing a "Restored N unsaved changes from previous session" notification to make this self-evident.

### Ctrl+W Selects Word (not close tab)
- Fresh uses `Ctrl+W` for "Select word under cursor."
- VS Code uses `Ctrl+W` for "Close tab." This is an intentional divergence.
- Docs: `docs/features/editing.md` confirms `Ctrl+W = Select word under cursor`.

### Revert = Discard Changes and Reload
- `File > Revert` shows a `(r)evert / (c)ancel?` prompt when the buffer is modified — this is correct.
- `File > Reload with Encoding...` DOES refuse with "Cannot reload: buffer has unsaved modifications" — this is also correct (it prevents overwriting local edits with a re-encoded version).
- ⚠️ Don't confuse these two menu items.

### Search Enter Closes After First Match
- This is by design. `Enter` = jump to match + close search bar.
- `F3` (after search closes) = navigate to next match.
- To cycle: `Ctrl+F` (pre-filled) → `Enter` → `F3` → `F3` ...

---

## UI Structure

### Layout
```
┌─ Menu bar (File / Edit / View / Selection / Go / LSP / Help) ─┐
├─ Tab bar ([Dashboard ×] [filename* ×])                        ─┤
│                                                                 │
│   Editor area (line numbers, ~ for empty lines)               │
│                                                                 │
└─ Status bar: mode | path [±] | Ln N, Col N | msg | enc | ⚠   ─┘
```

### Status Bar Indicators
| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `[+]` | Buffer has unsaved changes |
| `[RO]` | Read-only buffer |
| `*` in tab title | Same as `[+]` |
| `⚠ N` | N warnings/errors in diagnostics |
| `[⚠ 1]` on first launch | "Test i18n plugin loaded" (benign) |

### Selection Rendering (ANSI)
- Cursor character: `[48;5;16m` (near-black bg) or `[7m` (reverse video)
- Selected text: `[48;5;17m` (dark blue bg)
- Search match: `[48;5;17m` or `[48;5;226m` depending on theme
- Menu selected item: `[48;5;25m` (subtle dark blue — **easy to miss in non-ANSI capture**)

---

## tmux Interaction Rules

### Key Sending
```bash
# CORRECT — individual send-keys calls
tmux send-keys -t SESSION "S-Left" ""
sleep 0.2
tmux send-keys -t SESSION "S-Left" ""

# WRONG — sends literal text "S-Left S-Left"
tmux send-keys -t SESSION "S-Left S-Left" ""
```

### Key Name Reference
| Intent | tmux name |
|--------|-----------|
| Arrow keys | `Up` `Down` `Left` `Right` |
| Shift+Arrow | `S-Up` `S-Down` `S-Left` `S-Right` |
| Ctrl+key | `C-p` `C-f` `C-z` etc. |
| Alt/Meta+key | `M-f` `M-]` `M-[` etc. |
| Function keys | `F1` … `F12` |
| Home / End | `Home` `End` |
| Ctrl+Home/End | `C-Home` `C-End` |

### Timing
- After launching Fresh: sleep 2s before first capture
- Between selection keystrokes: sleep 0.2s minimum
- After Ctrl+P / menu open: sleep 0.5–1s
- After file operations: sleep 1s

### Verifying Menu Selection
Always use `tmux capture-pane -p -e` (with ANSI) to confirm which menu item is highlighted (`[48;5;25m`). Plain `-p` capture will not show the selection.

---

## Session / Testing Notes
- Fresh stores hot-exit state at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/fresh/` or `/tmp/fresh-$UID/`
- Each test run that makes edits will affect the next run via hot exit
- Use `fresh --no-restore` to launch without restoring previous session state (useful for clean-slate tests)
- "Calibrate Keyboard" in the command palette detects terminal key-translation issues

---

## Lessons Added in Run #7

### Lesson 29: Settings UI — Checkboxes ARE keyboard-navigable (Run #7 resolution)
- Previous run thought checkboxes were NOT reachable by Tab. CORRECTION:
  - ↑↓ arrows (DECCKM: `\033OA`/`\033OB`) navigate ALL items in the right panel, including checkboxes
  - Enter toggles the highlighted checkbox (`[ ]` → `[v]` or vice versa)
  - Tab ONLY reaches number/text inputs (skips checkboxes)
  - The `>` prefix in the right panel shows the selected item
  - Modified-but-unsaved items show `>●` (bullet = pending change)
- Confirmed via: Settings UI → search `/confirm_quit` → Enter → checkboxes are selectable

### Lesson 30: Settings Search — Press `/` in LEFT Panel
- In Settings UI, pressing `/` triggers a SEARCH mode over all setting names/descriptions
- This works from the LEFT panel (not the right panel)
- Search shows: "(N-12 of 38) ↓" result count with ↓ arrows to cycle
- The first match is auto-selected with `▸` arrow in the results
- Press Enter to navigate to the selected result's location in the right panel

### Lesson 31: select_to_paragraph escape sequences (confirmed Run #7)
- `Ctrl+Shift+Down` = CSI `1;6B` = `$'\033[1;6B'` in tmux → triggers `select_to_paragraph_down`
- `Ctrl+Shift+Up` = CSI `1;6A` = `$'\033[1;6A'` in tmux → triggers `select_to_paragraph_up`
- These escape sequences work correctly in Fresh's application terminal mode
- Selection renders as `[48;5;17m]` (dark blue background) on selected text

### Lesson 32: confirm_quit prompt behavior
- When enabled: pressing Ctrl+Q shows `Quit Fresh? (y)es, (N)o:` at the bottom line
- Requires letter + Enter to confirm: `y` then Enter = quits; `N` then Enter = stays
- Just pressing `N` alone appends to the prompt without cancelling (same pattern as Close Buffer)
- Status bar shows "Close cancelled" after pressing N+Enter

### Lesson 33: Live Grep 0.3.9 toolbar and scopes
- New toolbar format: `Search in: [v] Files Alt+L  [ ] Ignored Alt+H  [v] Buffers Alt+U  [v] Terminals Alt+T  [ ] Diagnostics Alt+D`
- Toggle with: Alt+L (Files), Alt+H (Ignored), Alt+U (Buffers), Alt+T (Terminals), Alt+D (Diagnostics)
- Match modes: Alt+O (Word), Alt+G (Regex) — these are toggles shown with [v]/[ ]
- Provider cycle: Alt+P — cycles git-grep → rg → grep → (back)
- Save matches: Alt+M — saves current matches to a buffer
- Result count in header: "1 / 1000" format; "1000+" means capped at 1000
- Buffer results tagged: `[buf]` prefix (e.g., `[buf] /tmp/fresh-test/sample.js:3`)
- Status "Searching…" during search, then result count replaces it

### Lesson 34: move_to_paragraph design context (PR #2084)
- PR #2084 deliberately omitted command palette entries for `move_to_paragraph_*`
- Reasoning: "just like `move left` command is not needed" (movement-only actions don't get palette entries)
- BUT: forgot to add DEFAULT KEYBINDING (unlike `select_to_paragraph_*` which have Ctrl+Shift+↓/↑)
- This is likely an oversight since the select variants DO have bindings
- Filed as BUG #2122
- Workaround: Keybinding Editor → `/paragraph` → select action → Enter → press desired key

## Lessons Added in Run #8

### Lesson 35: LSP Status Popup — Enter selects FIRST item (no Down navigation needed for first item)
- `Ctrl+P → "Show LSP Status"` or `Ctrl+P → "LSP: ..."` opens LSP server status popup
- Popup format: `○ rust-analyzer (not running)` / `Start rust-analyzer (always)` / `Start rust-analyzer once` / `Disable LSP for rust` / `View Log` / `Dismiss (Esc)`
- **CRITICAL**: DO NOT use DECCKM sequences (`$'\033OB'`) to navigate LSP popups — they will close the popup (ESC character dismisses it) and the remaining characters get typed into the editor buffer
- Enter selects the FIRST item (currently highlighted — the top option)
- For navigating popup options beyond the first, use plain tmux key names: `Down` / `Up` (NOT `$'\033OB'`/`$'\033OA'`)
- When LSP server not installed: Fresh tries to start it → spawns log file tab → status bar: "LSP (error)" → log tab shows full error backtrace
- LSP log file location: `/root/.local/state/fresh/logs/lsp/<name>-<pid>.log`
- LSP states visible in status bar: `LSP (off)`, `LSP (error)`, `LSP` (running)

### Lesson 36: Command Palette List Navigation — Use plain tmux key names
- For navigating the RESULTS LIST in the command palette (both command and file mode), use plain `Up`/`Down` tmux key names
- DECCKM sequences (`$'\033OA'`/`$'\033OB'`) start with ESC (`\033`) which CLOSES any open overlay/popup/palette
- So: `$'\033OA'` in palette input = ESC (closes palette) + literal `OA` typed somewhere
- Safe rule: DECCKM sequences ONLY for cursor movement within the EDITOR BUFFER itself
- All overlay/popup/dialog navigation: use plain `Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right` key names

### Lesson 37: Live Grep Alt+M — Saves to *Quickfix* buffer
- `Alt+M` in Live Grep closes the overlay and saves all current matches to a `*Quickfix*` [RO] buffer
- The Quickfix buffer opens in a new split pane
- Format: `file:line:col  match_content` (one per line)
- Header line: `Quickfix: <query> (N matches)`
- The Live Grep overlay is dismissed when Alt+M is pressed (replaced by the buffer)
- The *Quickfix* buffer is read-only and shows the full path
- To navigate to a match: use Ctrl+PgDn to switch to the Quickfix tab, then navigate to line and Enter to jump

### Lesson 38: C3 Language Support (0.3.9) — Working
- Fresh detects `.c3`, `.c3i`, `.c3t` extensions as C3 language
- Status bar shows `C3` language indicator
- Grammar: `c3.sublime-syntax` — full syntax highlighting for:
  - Keywords (`module`, `fn`, `struct`, `import`, `return`, `const`): cyan `[38;5;51m]`
  - Types (`int`, `double`, `void`, struct names): pink `[38;5;207m]`
  - Function names: yellow `[38;5;226m]`
  - Numbers: blue `[38;5;69m]`
  - Strings: green `[38;5;34m]`
  - Comments (`//`): gray `[38;5;253m]`
- Code folding indicators (▾/▸) appear at `fn` and `struct` declarations
- LSP configuration: `c3lsp` configured but not bundled — shows `LSP (off)` until c3lsp is on PATH
- C3 file can be opened from outside the project (e.g., `/tmp/test.c3`) via Ctrl+O

### Lesson 39: Orchestrator 0.3.9 UI Improvements
- New header format: `ORCHESTRATOR :: Sessions  —  [scope]` (scope = "all projects" or "user/fresh")
- **Alt+P (current only)**: Toggles between all-projects and current-project scope
  - All projects: `Project: [ All ▾   (Alt+P) ]`
  - Current project: `Project: [ fresh ▾   (Alt+P) ]`
  - Header also updates: "all projects" → "user/fresh"
- **Alt+T (show all worktrees)**: Checkbox toggle `[ ] Show all worktrees` / `[v] Show all worktrees`
- **Filter search**: Press `/` to enter the filter input box; type to filter session names
- **Alt+N (New Session)**: Opens session creation form
- Navigation keys (shown in footer): `↑↓ nav  Enter dive  Space select  Alt+P current only  Tab focus  Esc close`
- Session detail panel (right): `[ Visit ]  [ Details ]  [ Stop ]  [ Archive ]  [ Delete ]` action buttons
- BASE session always shown as the current running session

### Lesson 40: Review Diff Discard — FIXED in 0.3.9
- BUG #2117 (discard hunk fails with "patch does not apply") is FIXED in the 0.3.9 dev build
- Discard workflow now works correctly:
  1. Review Diff → `n` to navigate to hunk (status: "Hunk 1 of 1")
  2. Press `d` → confirmation dialog: "Discard this hunk in 'FILE'? This cannot be undone."
  3. Enter to confirm → status: "Review Diff: 0 hunks", panel: "No changes to review."
  4. File is reverted to HEAD state (git diff confirms no changes)
- Confirmed twice in Run #8

### Lesson 41: Live Grep Diagnostics Scope — No results without active LSP
- `Alt+D` toggles Diagnostics scope in Live Grep toolbar
- When only Diagnostics scope is enabled (`[ ] Files`, `[ ] Buffers`, `[ ] Terminals`, `[v] Diagnostics`):
  - Without an active LSP server: "No matches" for any search (even empty)
  - The Diagnostics scope searches LSP-generated diagnostics, not just file content
  - The `[⚠ N]` in status bar (from i18n plugin or LSP errors) does NOT populate Diagnostics scope
  - Provider line disappears when Diagnostics-only (no git-grep/rg needed for diagnostics search)
- When LSP is running and diagnosing code: Diagnostics scope would show matches against diagnostic messages

### Lesson 42: getWorkingDataDir() and getTerminalDir() plugin APIs (0.3.9)
- `editor.getWorkingDataDir()`: Per-working-directory data directory root for plugin storage
  - Different from `getThemesDir()` — scoped to the current project/worktree
  - Used for storing project-specific plugin data
- `editor.getTerminalDir()`: Directory holding terminal scrollback backing files for current working dir
  - Path: `<data_dir>/terminals/<encoded-cwd>/`
  - Used by Live Grep to scope "Terminals" search to the current project's terminals (not all terminals)
  - This is WHY Live Grep "Terminals" scope stays scoped to the current project

### Lesson 43: Workspace Session Isolation
- Sessions ARE correctly scoped per working directory
- Launching Fresh from `/home/user/fresh` restores the session for that directory only
- Launching Fresh from `/tmp/fresh-test-project` restores (or starts fresh) for that directory only
- External files opened from outside the project (e.g., `/tmp/file.txt` from a project session) ARE included in that project's session restore
- No cross-project tab mixing observed — issue #2056 appears resolved

## Lessons Added in Run #9

### Lesson 44: LSP Popup Navigation — Confirmed Plain Up/Down (final verification)
- Plain `Up`/`Down` tmux key names navigate LSP popup item lists correctly (confirmed Run #9)
- `Down` from the first highlighted item moves to the next selectable action item (skipping dimmed/non-selectable items)
- `Up` from "View Log" moved back to "Disable LSP for javascript" — navigation is bidirectional
- ANSI highlight `[48;5;25m]` confirms which item is currently selected in the popup
- Summary of popup structure for typescript-language-server: Status line (not selectable) → Install hint (dimmed, not selectable) → Disable LSP (selectable) → View Log (selectable) → Dismiss (Esc)

### Lesson 45: Quickfix Buffer Has No Navigation Keybindings (BUG #2124)
- The `*Quickfix*` buffer is a plain `[RO]` text buffer — NO special panel-mode bindings exist
- Pressing `Enter` on a match line shows "Editing disabled in this buffer" — does NOT jump to location
- `F8` (next error) also does not navigate Quickfix entries
- Keybinding Editor `/quickfix` shows ONLY export bindings (`Alt+M`, `Alt+Q` in `prompt` context)
- The internal design doc (`tui-editor-layout-design.md`) explicitly says Enter should navigate — but this was not implemented
- Workaround: manually read `file:line:col` and use `Ctrl+O` + `:N` palette navigation
- BUG #2124 filed

### Lesson 46: Diagnostics Panel Shortcuts Not Working (BUG #2125)
- Status bar hint `a: toggle filter | RET: goto | q: close` is shown when panel opens but these keys DON'T work
- Pressing `q`, `a`, or `Enter` in `*Diagnostics* [RO]` all produce "Editing disabled in this buffer"
- The panel body text `Enter:select | Esc:close` is display text only — NOT active keybindings
- Same root cause as BUG #2124: plain `[RO]` buffer, no panel-mode keybindings
- Only way to close: `Ctrl+P → "Toggle Diagnostics Panel"`
- BUG #2125 filed

### Lesson 47: Shell Command Feature (Alt+| and Alt+Shift+|) — Confirmed Working
- `Alt+|` (tmux: `M-|`): Opens "Shell command:" prompt at the bottom; runs command on selected text; output goes to NEW tab named `*Shell: <command>*`
- `Alt+Shift+|` (tmux: via command palette "Shell Command (Replace)"): Opens "Shell command (replace):" prompt; runs command on selection and REPLACES the selection in-place
- Both work with piped shell commands (tested: `sort`, `sort -r`)
- The `*Shell: <cmd>*` output buffer appears as a new tab (not a split pane)
- Both commands work with and without a selection (when no selection, operates on entire buffer)
- The output buffer is writable (no `[RO]` flag — unlike Quickfix/Diagnostics)

### Lesson 48: Add Cursors to Line Ends — Alt+Shift+I Confirmed Working
- `Alt+Shift+I` in tmux is sent as `M-I` (capital I) — the `Shift` is already encoded in the uppercase `I`
- Works correctly: select N lines → `M-I` → places cursor at end of each covered line
- Status bar confirms: `N cursors | Added cursors to line ends (N)`
- ANSI capture shows `[7m]` (reverse video) cursor indicator at line ends
- Tested with 5-line selection (lines 7-12): confirmed 6 cursors at line ends
- This is a 0.3.7 feature — confirmed working in 0.3.9

### Lesson 49: Settings UI Ctrl+R Behavior Investigation
- `Ctrl+R` while in the Settings panel CLOSES the Settings UI instead of resetting the focused field
- This is because `Ctrl+R` routes to the "Open Replace Bar" command globally, even within the Settings overlay
- The `[ Reset ]` button IS present in the Settings footer: `[ Edit ] [ User ] [ Reset ] [ Save ] [ Cancel ]`
- Tab cycling: Fields → `[ Edit ]` button → back to Fields (the `[ User ] [ Reset ] [ Save ] [ Cancel ]` buttons are NOT reachable via Tab cycling in the tested workflow)
- Ctrl+R "resets a field" (CHANGELOG 0.3.8) appears to be intended for when the cursor is INSIDE an active text/number input — further investigation needed
- WARNING: Settings navigation can leak keystrokes into the editor buffer — always Ctrl+Z undo after closing Settings

### Lesson 50: Settings Navigation Keystroke Leak Warning
- Settings UI can accidentally SAVE settings if Enter is pressed at wrong time
- The `/` search in Settings + Enter navigates to a field AND can trigger save
- The Tab key in the Settings right panel sometimes focuses a number field and immediately marks it as `●` (pending change) — be cautious
- After Settings interactions, ALWAYS check config file: `cat /root/.config/fresh/config.json`
- If incorrect values are saved, edit the config file directly and restart Fresh to pick up changes
