# Potential Improvements Backlog

This file accumulates UX, documentation, and feature improvement ideas discovered
during automated testing. These are NOT bugs — the application works as intended —
but they represent friction points that real users are likely to hit.

Each entry records: what confused us, what the correct behavior is, and what
change would make it self-evident without requiring users to read docs.

## UI / Discoverability

### IMP-001 — Hot Exit: No Indication That Restoration Happened
- **Observed:** On relaunch, files open with `[+]`/asterisk and no explanation.
- **Correct behavior:** Hot exit intentionally restored unsaved changes from the prior session.
- **Problem:** Users (and the test agent) see `[+]` and think something went wrong or the file is corrupted. Nothing tells them "we restored your previous session."
- **Suggested fix:** On first render after a hot-exit restore, show a dismissible status message or notification banner: *"Restored 2 unsaved buffers from your previous session. [`hot_exit` is on — disable in settings]"*
- **Effort:** Low — one status message in the restore path.
- **Discovered:** Run #1, 2026-05-26

### IMP-002 — Search Bar: No Hint for F3 / Shift+F3 Navigation
- **Observed:** The search bar shows `[x] Case Sensitive (Alt+C) | [ ] Whole Word (Alt+W) | [ ] Regex (Alt+R)` but no navigation hint.
- **Correct behavior:** After pressing Enter to jump to a match, `F3`/`Shift+F3` navigate next/previous. This is the correct workflow.
- **Problem:** Users (and the test agent) expect Enter to cycle through matches (VS Code behavior). Nothing in the UI signals that Enter closes the bar and F3 takes over.
- **Suggested fix:** Extend the hint line to: `[x] Case Sensitive (Alt+C)  [ ] Whole Word (Alt+W)  [ ] Regex (Alt+R)  |  Enter: jump · F3: next · Shift+F3: prev`
- **Effort:** Very low — add text to the search bar footer.
- **Discovered:** Run #1, 2026-05-26

### IMP-003 — Ctrl+H Terminal Compatibility Not Surfaced
- **Observed:** `Ctrl+H` is documented as Find & Replace but in terminals (including tmux) it is transmitted as ASCII `0x08` = Backspace. Pressing it silently deletes text.
- **Correct behavior:** `Ctrl+R` is the reliable Find & Replace shortcut; `Ctrl+H` is the *intended* shortcut but unreliable in terminals.
- **Problem:** Fresh markets "familiar VS Code/Sublime keybindings." VS Code users reach for Ctrl+H and destroy text with no warning.
- **Suggested fixes (pick one or combine):**
  1. Add `Ctrl+H` to the **Calibrate Keyboard** wizard's detection list, with a warning: *"Your terminal sends Ctrl+H as Backspace. The Find & Replace shortcut Ctrl+H may not work — use Ctrl+R instead."*
  2. Add a note to the keyboard reference doc next to the `Ctrl+H` entry: *"Note: many terminals transmit Ctrl+H as Backspace. If this doesn't open Find & Replace, use Ctrl+R."*
  3. On the first occurrence of a "delete previous word" action triggered by `0x08`, offer a one-time tooltip: *"Ctrl+H was received as Backspace. Did you mean Find & Replace? Use Ctrl+R."*
- **Effort:** Low–Medium.
- **Discovered:** Run #1, 2026-05-26

### IMP-004 — Menu Selection Highlight Too Subtle
- **Observed:** Navigating the menu bar with arrow keys works, but the selection highlight (`[48;5;25m` dark blue background) is nearly invisible in many terminal themes, making the menu appear unresponsive to keyboard input.
- **Correct behavior:** Arrow key navigation works correctly.
- **Problem:** Users (and the test agent's plain-text captures) cannot tell which menu item is highlighted. We initially reported this as "menu navigation doesn't work" before checking the ANSI output.
- **Suggested fix:** Use a higher-contrast selection color in the menu, or invert text color on selection, consistent with how the command palette highlights items.
- **Effort:** Low — theme/color change.
- **Discovered:** Run #1, 2026-05-26

### IMP-005 — Ctrl+W Diverges From VS Code Without Warning
- **Observed:** `Ctrl+W` selects the word under cursor. In VS Code/Sublime, `Ctrl+W` closes the current tab.
- **Correct behavior:** This is an intentional design choice in Fresh (documented in editing.md).
- **Problem:** VS Code users repeatedly pressing Ctrl+W to close tabs instead select words, which is invisible on some lines and confusing otherwise. There is no "close buffer" keyboard shortcut at all by default.
- **Suggested fixes:**
  1. Add a default `Ctrl+W` → "Close Buffer" keybinding, aliasing it alongside the word-select behavior (or make it context-sensitive: close if nothing is selected, select word if cursor is in a word).
  2. OR: In the "Getting Started" / welcome dashboard, call out this specific divergence from VS Code.
  3. OR: When a user presses Ctrl+W 3+ times in quick succession with no effect, show a hint: *"Ctrl+W selects the word under cursor. To close a buffer, use the command palette (Ctrl+P → 'Close Buffer')."*
- **Effort:** Medium (binding change) or Low (documentation/hint).
- **Discovered:** Run #1, 2026-05-26

### IMP-006 — "Reload with Encoding" Error Message Could Guide User Better
- **Observed:** `File > Reload with Encoding...` shows "Cannot reload: buffer has unsaved modifications (save first)" when the buffer is dirty.
- **Correct behavior:** The error is intentional — reloading with a different encoding would discard local edits.
- **Problem:** The error message is a dead end. The user knows they have unsaved changes but doesn't know what to do next.
- **Suggested fix:** Extend the message to: *"Cannot reload: buffer has unsaved modifications. Save first (Ctrl+S), or discard changes via Close Buffer → (d)iscard, then reopen."*
- **Effort:** Very low — improve error string.
- **Discovered:** Run #1, 2026-05-26

## Documentation Gaps

### IMP-007 — Session Persistence / Hot Exit Needs Prominent Mention on First Launch
- **Observed:** The Dashboard shows git/disk info but no mention of hot exit or session restore.
- **Suggested fix:** On the Dashboard (or a "first run" panel), add one line: *"Your editor state — open files, unsaved changes, and terminal sessions — is automatically saved on quit and restored on relaunch. Configure with `hot_exit` in settings."*
- **Effort:** Low.
- **Discovered:** Run #1, 2026-05-26

---

### IMP-008 — "Split Vertical" Command Creates Horizontal Layout
- **Observed:** The command palette entry "Split Vertical" creates a horizontal layout (two panes stacked, divided by a horizontal line).
- **Correct behavior:** This is consistent with many editors where "vertical split" = a vertical *divider* (side by side), but Fresh's "Split Vertical" creates a *horizontal divider* (stacked). The naming is the reverse of what VS Code users expect.
- **Suggested fix:** Rename to "Split Horizontally" and add a "Split Vertically" (side by side) command. Or add parenthetical descriptions: "Split Vertical (stacked)" vs "Split Horizontal (side by side)".
- **Effort:** Low — rename + add second variant.
- **Discovered:** Run #1, 2026-05-26

## Testing Infrastructure

### IMP-009 — No `--headless` or Scriptable Test Mode
- **Observed:** The TUI agent must use tmux to interact with Fresh. This works but is fragile — timing-dependent, ANSI parsing is complex, and key send errors produce hard-to-diagnose bugs (e.g., "S-Left S-Left" sent as literal text).
- **Suggested fix:** A `fresh --test-mode` or pipe-based command interface that accepts structured input (JSON events) and produces structured output (cursor position, buffer content, status) would make automated testing far more reliable.
- **Effort:** High — new subsystem. But would significantly improve the quality of Fresh's own e2e test suite as well.
- **Discovered:** Run #1, 2026-05-26
