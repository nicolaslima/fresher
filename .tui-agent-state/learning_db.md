# Fresh TUI Editor — Knowledge Base

## Application Overview
- **Name:** Fresh — a modern terminal text editor
- **Binary:** `/opt/node22/bin/fresh` (installed via npm @fresh-editor/fresh-editor)
- **Version:** 0.3.9
- **Launch:** `fresh [file]` — opens with optional file argument
- **Session Persistence:** Fresh restores all previously open buffers on next launch (built-in session memory)

## tmux Session Setup
- Session: `fresh-tui-test`
- Size: 220 columns × 50 rows
- Create: `tmux new-session -d -s fresh-tui-test -x 220 -y 50`
- Kill: `tmux kill-session -t fresh-tui-test`
- Send keys: `tmux send-keys -t fresh-tui-test 'text' Enter`
- Read output: `tmux capture-pane -t fresh-tui-test -p`
- Read with colors: `tmux capture-pane -t fresh-tui-test -p -e`

## Critical tmux send-keys Notes
- Spaces in `send-keys` arguments are interpreted as KEY SEPARATORS
  - BAD: `tmux send-keys -t s "Split H"` → sends "Split" (invalid key) and "H" (capital H)
  - GOOD: `tmux send-keys -t s 'S' 'p' 'l' 'i' 't' ' ' 'H'` → sends each char individually
- Special key names: Enter, Escape, BSpace (backspace), Space, Up/Down/Left/Right, Home/End
- Ctrl keys: `C-a`, `C-p`, `C-z`, etc.
- Alt keys: `M-w`, `M-a`, etc.  
- Shift+arrow: `S-Down`, `S-Up`, `S-Left`, `S-Right`
- F-keys: `F1`, `F3`, `F10` — but F10 reliability is timing-dependent (can insert `[21~]` escape sequence)

## Menu Bar Navigation
- **F10** — opens File menu (first menu)
- **Right/Left** — navigate between menus while one is open
- **Down/Up** — navigate within a menu (WARNING: Down from File menu switches to Edit; can confuse)
- **Escape** — close menu
- **Enter** — execute menu item
- Menu order: File | Edit | View | Selection | Go | LSP | Help
- Menu navigation with 3+ separate Right presses correctly navigates: File→Edit→View→Selection

## Key Bindings (Confirmed)
### File Operations
- **Ctrl+N** — New File (new empty buffer tab)
- **Ctrl+O** — Open File (file picker with browser + sizes/timestamps)
- **Ctrl+S** — Save (prompts Save As for new buffers)
- **Ctrl+Q** — Quit (no prompt for unsaved new buffers)
- **Alt+W** — Close Tab (but ALSO toggles whole-word search depending on context!)
- **Close Buffer** (command palette) — prompts save/discard for modified buffers

### Save/Discard Dialog
- Prompt: `'[filename]' modified. (s)ave, (d)iscard, (C)ancel? `
- Input: Type letter + Enter (NOT single keypress)
- 's' + Enter → save
- 'd' + Enter → discard
- 'C' + Enter or Escape → cancel

### Editing
- **Ctrl+Z** — Undo (single character/action granularity)
- **Ctrl+Y** — Redo
- **Ctrl+X** — Cut
- **Ctrl+C** — Copy (shows "Copied" status)
- **Ctrl+V** — Paste
- **Ctrl+A** — Select All
- **Ctrl+W** — Select Word (at cursor)
- **Ctrl+L** — Select Line
- **Ctrl+D** — Add cursor at next match (multi-cursor)
- **Ctrl+/** — Toggle Comment (works on code files; no effect on plain text)
- **Ctrl+Alt+↑/↓** — Add cursor above/below
- **Alt+Shift+I** — Add cursors to line ends

### Navigation
- **Ctrl+G** — Go to Line (prompt at bottom: type number + Enter)
- **Ctrl+Right/Left** — Word movement
- **Shift+Down/Up/Left/Right** — Selection extend
- **Ctrl+PgDn / Ctrl+NPage** — Next Buffer/Tab
- **Ctrl+PgUp / Ctrl+PPage** — Previous Buffer/Tab
- **Home/End** — Beginning/End of line
- **F3** — Find Next (uses last search)
- **Shift+F3** — Find Previous

### Search & Replace
- **Ctrl+F** — Find (bar at bottom with options)
  - **Alt+C** — Toggle Case Sensitive
  - **Alt+W** — Toggle Whole Word  
  - **Alt+R** — Toggle Regex
  - **Enter** — Jump to current match and CLOSE search bar
  - **F3** — Next match WITHOUT closing search bar
- **Ctrl+Alt+R** — Query Replace
  - First field: search term (Enter to advance)
  - Second field: replacement (Enter to start)
  - Per-match: y=yes, n=skip, a=all remaining, c=cancel
- **Alt+A** — Search and Replace in Project (cross-file)

### Views
- **Ctrl+B** — Toggle File Explorer (sidebar with directory tree)
- **F10** — Access menu bar
- **Ctrl+`** / **Alt+`** — Open Terminal in Utility Dock

### Command Palette
- **Ctrl+P** — Open Command Palette
  - Default mode: `>command` (command search)
  - Delete `>` → `file` mode (fuzzy file search)
  - `:` → line mode
  - `#` → buffer mode
  - Type characters with spaces: use single-char `send-keys` format

### Terminal
- **Alt+`** — Open Terminal in Utility Dock
- **Ctrl+Space** — Toggle terminal input mode (enter/exit interactive terminal)
- When terminal mode active: editor keyboard shortcuts are captured by terminal
- Close terminal split via "Close Split" command

## UI Layout
- Menu bar: top row (File/Edit/View/Selection/Go/LSP/[Explorer]/Help)
- Tab bar: second row (shows all open buffers, * = modified)
- Editor area: main area with line numbers + content
- Status bar: bottom-1 (filename, cursor pos, status message, encoding, filetype, hint)
- Dialogs/prompts: appear at very bottom (BELOW status bar) — easy to miss!

## Status Bar Format
`Local | [filename] [+] | Ln N, Col N | [message] | encoding | filetype | hint`
- `[+]` = unsaved changes (same as `*` in tab)
- Encoding: UTF-8, ASCII, LF
- Filetype: Text, TOML, Rust, etc.
- Hint: "Palette: Ctrl+P" = normal mode; "Terminal mode..." = in terminal

## Important Behaviors

### Session Persistence
Fresh remembers all open buffers across sessions. Each launch restores the previous state. This means test buffers accumulate. Explicitly close/discard them before each run.

### Multi-cursor
1. Position cursor at first word
2. Ctrl+W to select word
3. Ctrl+D to add cursor at NEXT occurrence
4. Repeat Ctrl+D for more cursors
5. Type to edit all cursors simultaneously

### Save/Discard Dialog
The save prompt appears at the VERY BOTTOM of the screen, below the status bar. Typing after the dialog opens inputs into the dialog's text field (not the editor). Always check for this dialog before typing.

### Alt+W Quirk
Alt+W behaves differently depending on context:
- In search bar: toggles Whole Word search option
- On a tab (when not in search): closes the tab ("Close Tab")
- Outside search, while in editing: may toggle whole-word setting (BUG CANDIDATE)
Safer alternative: Use "Close Buffer" or "Close Tab" commands via Ctrl+P.

### F10 Reliability
F10 can sometimes insert escape sequence `[21~]` into the active buffer instead of opening the menu. This is timing-dependent with tmux. If this happens, undo with Ctrl+Z. Prefer using command palette (Ctrl+P) for menu actions.

### Large File Mode
Fresh enters a "virtual byte-offset mode" for large files (observed at 49MB / 500K lines):
- Status bar shows: `Byte N` instead of `Ln N, Col N`
- Gutter shows BYTE OFFSETS (0, 98, 196...) instead of line numbers
- Navigation (Ctrl+End to bottom) is immediate
- Search still works (found 2 matches in <2s for 49MB file)

### Binary File Mode
Fresh opens binary files gracefully:
- Tab title shows `[BIN]` tag (e.g., `ls [BIN] ×`)
- Non-printable bytes rendered as `<XX>` hex notation
- No crash, no freeze
- Line wrap applies to binary content

### Go to Matching Bracket
- Command: "Go to Matching Bracket" in command palette
- Shortcut: `Ctrl+]` (but `Ctrl+]` = ASCII 0x1D may not transmit correctly via tmux send-keys)
- Use command palette invocation for testing: `Ctrl+P` → type "matching" → Enter
- Works on: `(` → `)`, `{` → `}`, and presumably `[` → `]`

### Position History
- `Alt+Left` = Go Back in position history (previous cursor positions)
- `Alt+Right` = Go Forward in position history
- History is built by navigating (Ctrl+G jumps, bracket matches, etc.)
- Works across lines (tested: lines 5 → line 1 via Alt+Left)

### Alt+W Confirmed Behavior (NOT a bug)
- Normal editing mode (not in search bar): `Alt+W` = **Close Tab** ("Tab closed" status)
- Search bar active: `Alt+W` = **Toggle Whole Word** (search option)
- This is correct context-sensitive behavior, not a bug

### Line Wrap Toggle
- View menu → `☑ Line Wrap` item toggles wrapping
- No keyboard shortcut (use View menu or command palette if it exists)
- Default state: ON (confirmed by visual wrap of long lines at startup)
- No "Toggle Line Wrap" found in command palette — must use View menu

## Alt+A — Project-wide Search & Replace Panel

### Panel Layout
- Opens at the bottom of the screen as a split panel
- Two fields: `Search:` and `Replace:` (Tab to navigate between them)
- Scope checkbox: `[v] All Files` (when checked, searches all project files)
- Options: `Case (Alt+C)`, `Regex (Alt+R)`, `Whole Word (Alt+W)`
- Replace button changes context-sensitively to "Replace All in [filename] (Alt+Ret)" when scoped
- Match list: grouped by file with counts (e.g. `▼ [v] TX tmp_test_files/test_file1.txt (3/3)`)
- Hint line: `Tab next  Space include/exclude  Enter open  Alt+Ret replace selected  Esc close`

### Key Behaviors
- **Scope via Space:** Pressing Space on a file group header toggles its inclusion
  - When pressed on a non-current-file group, it deselects "All Files" and scopes to current file only
  - Shows `Only in: [filename]` indicator when scoped
- **Replace confirmation:** "Replace N match(es) in M file(s)? Undo only covers files still open. Press Enter to confirm, Esc to cancel."
- **Outside-workspace files:** Fixed in commit b7e7e64 — files outside the workspace root (e.g., /tmp) ARE now included in search results
- **Status**: Shows match count in status bar and "Replaced N occurrences in M files" after replace

## Calibrate Keyboard Wizard

### Overview
- Command: "Calibrate Keyboard" in command palette
- Steps: 24 steps across 5 groups
- Groups: Basic Editing, Line Navigation, Word Navigation, Document Navigation, Emacs-Style
- Controls: `[s]` Skip key, `[b]` Back, `[g]` Skip group, `[a]` Abort

### Groups and Keys Tested
1. **Basic Editing**: BACKSPACE, DELETE, TAB, SHIFT+TAB
2. **Line Navigation**: HOME, END, SHIFT+HOME, SHIFT+END (and others)
3. **Word Navigation**: ALT+LEFT/RIGHT, ALT+SHIFT+LEFT/RIGHT, CTRL+LEFT/RIGHT, CTRL+SHIFT+LEFT/RIGHT
4. **Document Navigation**: PAGE UP, PAGE DOWN (and others)
5. **Emacs-Style**: CTRL+A, CTRL+E, CTRL+K, CTRL+Y

### Key Finding
- **Does NOT test CTRL+H** — the terminal compatibility issue (#2109, Ctrl+H = Backspace) is NOT addressed by the wizard
- The wizard would need a group for "Troublesome Keys" to detect this (see IMP-003)
- Final screen: "Input Calibration - Verify" with `[y] Save [a] Abort`
- Summary shows: "All Keys Working!" if all captured keys matched expected

### Rapid Input Behavior
- Fresh handles rapid keystrokes without dropped input (tested: 50 chars at full tmux speed)
- Rapid Ctrl+Z (20 × with no delay) correctly undoes char-by-char with no corruption
- All keys in fast-burst sequences are received and processed correctly

### Resize Reflow
- Fresh adapts layout correctly when tmux window is resized (220×50 → 80×24 → 180×40)
- Status bar truncates gracefully: `Ln 1, Col 1` becomes `Ln 1, ...` at narrow widths
- Resize mid-typing produces no corruption or dropped characters
- Editor remains fully responsive after resize

## Flash: Jump Plugin
- Command: "Flash: Jump" in command palette
- Behavior: Overlays single-character hint labels on every visible word/position in the editor
- Pressing a hint character jumps the cursor to that position
- Status bar shows "Flash[]" while active
- Works correctly — cursor moves to the position labeled by the typed hint char

## Package Manager
- Commands: "Package: Packages" and "Package: Install from URL" (source: `pkg`)
- **Package: Packages** opens a package browser buffer with:
  - Package list (left panel): 13 available packages with type tags [P]=Plugin, [T]=Theme, [L]=Language
  - Detail panel (right): version, author, license, description, tags, repo URL, [Install] button
  - Filter tabs at top: All | Installed | Plugins | Themes | Languages | Bundles | Sync
  - `/` opens search input; Enter confirms; search filters list by name/description
  - Status bar: "Registry synced (N/N sources)"
  - Navigation: ↑↓ navigate, Tab next, / search, Enter select, Esc close
- **Package: Install from URL** shows "Git URL or local path:" prompt at bottom

## Live Diff Plugin
- Commands all prefixed "Live Diff:" in command palette (source: `live_diff`)
- Available modes: vs HEAD, vs Disk (unsaved changes), vs Branch..., vs Default Branch, Refresh, Toggle (Buffer), Toggle (Global), Set Default Mode
- **vs HEAD**: Green `│` gutter markers (ANSI 38;5;78) on added lines; green background (48;5;22) on added content. Status: "Live Diff: comparing against HEAD"
- **vs Disk**: `+` marker (ANSI 38;5;71) on lines in buffer not yet saved. Status: "Live Diff: comparing against file on disk"
- **vs Branch...**: Prompts "Branch or ref" input with "main" pre-filled. Status: "Live Diff: comparing against [branch]"
- All modes confirmed working and switching via status bar confirmation

## Block Selection (Alt+Shift+Arrow)
- **Keys (confirmed working in Run #15):**
  - Block select down: `M-S-Down` (Alt+Shift+↓)
  - Block select up: `M-S-Up` (Alt+Shift+↑)
  - Block select left: `M-S-Left` (Alt+Shift+←)
  - Block select right: `M-S-Right` (Alt+Shift+→)
- **Behavior:** Rectangular (column) selection — same columns selected on every row
- **Confirmed by:** Selecting "Line " (5 chars, cols 1-5) on rows 1-4, then typing '>' replaced it on all rows simultaneously
- **Note:** Run #12 reported M-S-Down did NOT work. Run #15 confirms it DOES work on this build. The key sequences are correct.

## Dev Container Features
- Commands all prefixed "Dev Container:" in command palette (source: `devcontainer`)
- **Create Config**: Creates `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` with minimal Ubuntu base template `{"name": "...", "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:ubuntu"}`
- **Show Info**: Opens `*Dev Container*` panel showing container name, image, action buttons (Run Lifecycle, Open Config, Rebuild, Close). Controls: Tab cycle, Enter activate, Alt+r run, Alt+o open, Alt+b rebuild, **q close** (q works here, unlike *Keyboard Shortcuts*)
- **Show Features**: Returns "No features configured" if devcontainer.json has no features section
- **Show Forwarded Ports**: Opens panel with "No configured or runtime ports to show."; controls: r refresh, q/Esc close
- **Without devcontainer.json**: "No devcontainer.json found" status message
- These Dev Container panels properly close with 'q' — showing the 'q' issue is specific to certain [RO] buffer types

## Live Grep Provider Cycling
- Alt+P cycles providers: git-grep → rg → grep → (back to git-grep)
- Only 3 providers available in this environment (command palette says rg, ag, git-grep, ack, fff, grep — but only 3 installed)
- Search results appear for all providers with match count ("1000+" for common terms)
- Provider shown in toolbar as "[ git-grep ]", "[ rg ]", "[ grep ]"

  - Binary built from release profile (target/release/fresh) on branch claude/awesome-clarke-jWgGn

## Git Blame Plugin
- Command: "Git Blame" in command palette (source: `git_blame`)
- Opens `*blame:<filename>*` [RO] buffer with per-line commit annotations
- Format: `── <hash> (<author>, <time>) "<commit message>" ──` as block header
- Status bar: "Git blame: N blocks | b: blame at parent | q: close"
- **'b'** — go back to parent commit of current line's commit
  - If file was added in that commit (initial), shows: "Cannot get blame at SHA^ (may be initial commit or file didn't exist)"
- **'q'** — closes the blame panel correctly (unlike *Keyboard Shortcuts* buffer)
- Tested on: single-commit files and README.md (monorepo context)

## Package Manager: Install via URL
- **Install command:** "Package: Install from URL" (command palette)
- **Prompt:** "Git URL or local path:" at the bottom
- **URL format for monorepo plugins:** `https://github.com/owner/repo#subfolder`
  - Example: `https://github.com/sinelaw/fresh-plugins#color-highlighter`
- **After install:** Status shows "Installed and activated <name> v<version>"
- **Package location:** `/root/.config/fresh/plugins/packages/<name>/`
- **Package files:** `<name>.ts`, `<name>.i18n.json`, `package.json`
- **Uninstall:** No "Package: Uninstall" command exists. Must delete package directory manually: `rm -rf /root/.config/fresh/plugins/packages/<name>/`
  - Fresh detects removal in real-time (no restart needed)
  - Plugin deactivates immediately when directory deleted

## Package Manager: UI Navigation Notes
- Package browser Tab cycle (from list item): 
  - Tab 1: "Enter Select" (list navigation)
  - Tab 2: "Enter Activate" (shows `[ Install ]`/`[ Uninstall ]` brackets in right panel)  
  - Tab 3-4: "Enter Search" (search field)
  - Tab 5-9+: "Enter Filter" (filter tabs: All, Installed, Plugins, Themes, Languages, Bundles)
  - Tab 10-11: "Enter Sync" (Sync tab)
- ⚠️ Tab 2 "Enter Activate" MAY activate the search field rather than the Install button (inconsistent behavior observed — further testing needed)
- For reliable install: use "Package: Install from URL" command in palette
- For uninstall: manually delete the plugin directory

## Color Highlighter Plugin
- Install URL: `https://github.com/sinelaw/fresh-plugins#color-highlighter`
- Commands: "Color Highlighter: Enable", "Color Highlighter: Disable", "Color Highlighter: Toggle"
- **Enable behavior:** Shows filled block `█` character before each color code
  - `#ff0000` → `[38;5;196m█` (red, ANSI 256-color approximation)
  - `rgb(0, 128, 255)` → `[38;5;33m█` (blue)
  - `hsl(120, 100%, 50%)` → `[38;5;46m█` (green)
  - `#abc` → `[38;5;145m█` (light blue/lavender = #aabbcc)
- Supports CSS files and any file with color expressions
- Plugin activates immediately on install (no restart needed)
- Plugin deactivates in real-time on file deletion (no restart needed)

## Dev Container: Attach Error Handling
- When devcontainer CLI is NOT installed:
  - Dialog: "Dev Container CLI Not Found"
  - Message: "The devcontainer CLI is needed for rebuild. Copy the install command below, or dismiss."
  - Shows: "Copy: npm i -g @devcontainers/cli"
  - Dismiss with ESC
- When devcontainer.json is NOT found: status shows "No devcontainer.json found" (no dialog)
- Docker daemon not running does NOT affect this error path (CLI check happens before docker check)

## File Explorer (Run #17)
- **Toggle sidebar:** `Ctrl+B` — shows/hides file explorer sidebar
- **Focus explorer:** `Ctrl+E` — moves keyboard focus from editor to file explorer
- **Navigation:** Up/Down = move cursor; Right = expand directory; Left = collapse directory; Enter = open file (permanent)
- **Auto-preview:** Cursor movement auto-previews files in editor without permanently opening them
- **New file:** `Ctrl+N` when explorer is focused (NOT when editor is focused) — creates file in current dir
- **Delete file:** `Delete` key when file is highlighted → confirmation `y`/`n` → "Moved to trash" on confirm
- **IMPORTANT:** `Ctrl+N` when editor is focused = new buffer, NOT explorer new file. Must press `Ctrl+E` first to focus explorer.
- The `>` prefix in file names (or tree node markers) distinguishes folders from files.

## Settings Panel Navigation (Run #17)
- **Open settings:** Command palette `Ctrl+P` → "Open Settings"
- **Panel structure:** 3-panel overlay: [Categories list | Settings items | Right content panel]
- **Tab cycle:** Categories → Settings → Footer → Categories (one Tab per panel)
- **Categories panel:** When focused (blue `[48;5;25m` bg + `>` prefix), Up/Down navigates categories; right panel updates to show that category's settings
- **Settings panel:** When focused, Up/Down navigates between individual setting controls. Each control shows a description box below it.
- **Footer panel:** Shows `[ Edit ]  [ User ]  [ Reset ]  [ Save ]  [ Cancel ]`. Tab cycles: Save → Cancel → Edit → wrap to Categories (Layer/Reset buttons skipped by Tab per known usability bug).
- **Enter in Settings panel:** For Toggle = toggle value; for Dropdown = open dropdown; for Number = enter edit mode; for TextList = enters editing mode (Up/Down navigate items, Delete removes, Enter confirms/adds)
- **TextList interaction model:**
  1. Navigate to TextList header (e.g., "Sources:") with Up/Down in Settings panel
  2. Press Up to navigate INTO existing items (cursor moves to items list)
  3. Item focused state: item text shown with blue bracket color `[38;5;25m`, hint text "Del:remove  Enter:edit" appears
  4. Press Delete to remove focused item; Enter opens inline editor for item text
  5. Tab exits TextList (jumps to next panel in Tab cycle)
- **TextList [x] buttons:** Visual-only for mouse users; NOT keyboard-accessible via Tab. Keyboard deletion = Delete key.
- **Escape behavior:** Closes settings and DISCARDS unsaved changes (no confirmation dialog when changes are pending — contrary to expectation)
- **Selection highlight:** Blue `[48;5;25m` background = keyboard focus; `[48;5;17m]` darker blue = modified/active indicator
- **Modification indicator:** `●` appears next to setting label when value differs from default

## LSP: Pyright Status (Run #17)
- **pyright-langserver** (from `pip install pyright`): Initialize handshake SUCCEEDS ("LSP (python) ready")
- BUT all request-based features TIMEOUT after 30s: hover, definition, completion, signatureHelp, diagnostics
- Log evidence: warnings log shows 10 timeouts; `LSP initialize result: position_encoding=None` (suspicious)
- pyright processes (Python wrapper + Node child) both running but idle (sleeping state = waiting for input)
- Bug filed: #2197
- **Suspected cause:** Position encoding mismatch — `position_encoding=None` may mean Fresh defaults to UTF-16 but pyright expects UTF-8, causing it to silently discard all subsequent requests
- **Alternative to try next run:** clangd on a tiny C project (avoid rust-analyzer = too heavy)

## LSP: clangd Integration (Run #18)
- **Install:** `apt-get install clangd` (not pre-installed; installs clangd-18 via Ubuntu package)
- **Config for clangd:** `{"lsp": {"c": {"command": "clangd", "args": ["--log=verbose"], "enabled": true}}}`
- **compile_commands.json:** Place in project root to help clangd find include paths
- **Auto-start behavior:** Despite `enabled: true` in config, clangd shows as "not running" on Fresh launch. Must manually start via LSP Status popup (click/run "Show LSP Status" → "Start clangd (always)"). After "Start clangd (always)", LSP shows "ready".
- **Confirmed working features:**
  - Hover (Alt+K): Shows function signature popup
  - Go to Definition (F12): Jumps to definition, "Jumped to definition at <file>:<line>" in status
  - Completions (Ctrl+Space): Shows typed-function-matching completions with signature
  - Find References (Shift+F12): Opens popup with all reference locations
  - Rename Symbol (F2): Prompts "Rename to:", renames at definition + all call sites
  - Inlay hints: Auto-shown (parameter names in call sites, e.g., "add(a: 3, b: 4)")
- **Code Actions (Alt+.):** "No code actions available" at C error location (undeclared malloc). May be clangd limitation — C++ errors typically have more code actions. Needs further testing with C++ or different error type.
- **Language ID:** Use "c" (lowercase) in config.json for C files (Fresh detects .c files as language "C")
- **LSP Status popup format:** `○ clangd (not running)` then options: "Start clangd (always)", "Start clangd once", "Disable LSP for c", "View Log", "Dismiss"

## text-actions Plugin (Run #18)
- **Install URL:** `https://github.com/PavelLoparev/fresh-text-actions-plugin`
- **No subfolder needed** (standalone repo, not monorepo)
- **Version:** v0.1.0
- **Status after install:** "Installed and activated fresh-text-actions-plugin v0.1.0"
- **Commands added (source: "plugin"):**
  - "Encode String to Base64"
  - "Encode String to JSON String"
  - "Encode String to URI Component Encoded"
  - "Encode String to URI Encoded"
  - "Decode URI Component Encoded to String"
  - "Decode URI Encoded to String"
  - "Encode JSON Byte Array to Hex String"
- **Usage:** Select text BEFORE opening command palette. Ctrl+L (select line) + Ctrl+P works reliably. Ctrl+A + Ctrl+P may lose selection.
- **Base64 verified:** "Hello World" → "SGVsbG8gV29ybGQ=" (correct)
- **Uninstall:** `rm -rf /root/.config/fresh/plugins/packages/fresh-text-actions-plugin`

## Encoding Handling (Run #19)
- **Auto-detection:** Fresh auto-detects encoding on file open. Latin-1 encoded files are detected as "Windows-1252" (a superset — correct and reasonable).
- **Status bar encoding:** Shows current encoding (e.g., `LF  Windows-1252  Text`)
- **Reload with Encoding...** command (command palette or File menu):
  - Opens an encoding picker with 8+ encodings: UTF-8, UTF-8 BOM, UTF-16 LE, UTF-16 BE, ASCII, Latin-1, Windows-1252 (+ more)
  - Current encoding marked with "current" label in the picker
  - Bottom prompt shows selected encoding name: "Reload with encoding: Latin-1"
  - Navigation: Up/Down; use ANSI capture (`-e`) to confirm highlighted item (`[48;5;25m` background)
  - Pressing Enter reloads the file from disk with the selected encoding
  - Characters render correctly after reload with correct encoding
- **Set Encoding** command (command palette):
  - Same encoding picker as Reload
  - Changes the BUFFER encoding (how Fresh interprets/saves the bytes) without reloading from disk
  - Marks buffer as modified `[+]` with asterisk `*` in tab title
  - Status: "Encoding set to UTF-8"
  - Saving after Set Encoding writes the file in the new encoding
  - **Round-trip verified:** Latin-1 file → Set Encoding to UTF-8 → Save → file bytes are valid UTF-8 (confirmed by hex)
- **Encoding picker navigation tip:** Arrow keys work; plain-text capture doesn't show selection — use `capture-pane -e` and grep for `48;5;25m` to find highlighted item

## Themes (Run #19)
- **8 themes in v0.3.8:** dark, dracula, high-contrast, light, nord, nostalgia, solarized-dark, terminal
- **"nord" is NEW** compared to the list observed in earlier tests (v0.3.9 had 7 themes without nord)
- **Select Theme** command in command palette; no default keyboard shortcut
- **Theme picker navigation:** Arrow keys; current theme marked "(current)" in list; ANSI `-e` capture needed to see selection highlight (`48;5;25m`)
- **Theme apply confirmation:** Status bar shows "Theme changed to '[name]'"
- **ANSI color evidence (selected samples):**
  - high-contrast: menu bar `38;5;231m` fg, `48;5;236m` bg
  - dark: menu bar `38;5;252m` fg, `48;5;237m` bg
  - light: menu bar `38;5;234m` fg, `48;5;254m` bg (near-white background)
  - nord: menu bar `38;5;188m` fg, `48;5;237m` bg (light blue-grey text)

## LSP: auto_start Setting (Run #19)
- **Config schema defines:** `auto_start: boolean, default: false`
  - Description: "Whether to auto-start this LSP server when opening matching files. If false (default), the server must be started manually via command palette"
- **`enabled: true`** ≠ auto-start. It means "this server is configured and not disabled."
- **To auto-start:** Set `"auto_start": true` in LSP config. Example:
  ```json
  {"lsp": {"cpp": {"command": "clangd", "enabled": true, "auto_start": true}}}
  ```
- **Built-in LSP config docs:** "Fresh will use it automatically" = the CONFIG is pre-built (no manual JSON needed). NOT that the server auto-launches.
- **Without `auto_start: true`:** User must open LSP Status popup and click "Start [server] (always)" to start it

## LSP: Code Actions Root Cause (Run #19)
- **Bug #2212:** Fresh always sends `"context":{"diagnostics":[]}` (empty array) in all `textDocument/codeAction` requests
- **Effect:** clangd's fix-based code actions (triggered by diagnostics) are never returned — clangd returns `[]` when `context.diagnostics` is empty
- **LSP log evidence:**
  - Incoming: `publishDiagnostics` with N diagnostics including `"(fix available)"` markers
  - Outgoing: `codeAction` with `{"context":{"diagnostics":[]},"range":...}`
  - Reply: `{"result":[]}`
- **Root cause (from closed issue #1915 source comment):** `// TODO: Implement diagnostic retrieval when needed` in `app/lsp_requests.rs`
- **Not a clangd limitation:** This is a Fresh implementation gap. Clangd DOES return fix actions — but requires the diagnostic objects in the context.
- **Affected:** All diagnostic-based code actions for any LSP server (clangd, potentially others). Non-diagnostic refactoring actions may also be absent for other reasons.

## Git Blame: Multi-Commit History Navigation (Run #18)
- **'b' key behavior with multi-commit files:** Navigates to PARENT commit of the commit on the current cursor line
- **Depth tracking:** Status bar shows "Git blame at <SHA>^ | depth: N | b: go deeper | q: close"
  - depth: 0 = HEAD blame (initial state)
  - depth: 1 = one parent commit back
  - depth: 2 = two parent commits back
  - etc.
- **Confirmed on CHANGELOG.md (399 blame blocks):**
  - Line 3 at HEAD: bc11f2b (1 week ago)
  - After 'b': 059f4ab (2 weeks ago) at depth: 1
  - After 'b' again: 60d0ba2 (2 weeks ago) at depth: 2
- **When at initial commit:** "Cannot get blame at <SHA>^ (may be initial commit or file didn't exist)"
- **Important:** Fresh must be launched from the git repo directory for git blame to work. If launched from /tmp, git blame returns "No blame information available (not a git file or error)"

## text-actions Plugin: Full Decode Command Set (Run #20 — updated)

Learning_db.md previously documented only 7 commands. The plugin v0.1.0 has MORE commands:

**Encode commands:**
- "Encode String to Base64"
- "Encode String to JSON String"
- "Encode String to URI Component Encoded"
- "Encode String to URI Encoded"
- "Encode JSON Byte Array to Hex String"

**Decode commands (previously MISSING from docs):**
- "Decode Base64 to String" — `"SGVsbG8gV29ybGQ="` → `"Hello World"` ✅
- "Decode URI Component Encoded to String" — `"Hello%20World%21"` → `"Hello World!"` ✅
- "Decode URI Encoded to String" (also present)
- "Decode JSON String to String" — `"Hello\nWorld\t!"` → multiline with ANSI newline+tab ✅
- "Decode Hex String to JSON Byte Array" — `"48656c6c6f"` → `"[72,101,108,108,111]"` ✅

**Round-trip verified:** "Fresh Editor 2026" → Base64 → decode → "Fresh Editor 2026" (exact match to `echo -n "Fresh Editor 2026" | base64`)

**Usage:** Select text with Ctrl+L (select line) BEFORE opening command palette. All commands work on selected text (replace selection with result).

## Bookmarks (Run #20 — full slot test)
- **Set:** Ctrl+P → "Set Bookmark" → Enter → type digit (0-9) + Enter → "Bookmark 'N' set"
- **Jump:** Alt+N (where N = 0-9). Status: "Jumped to bookmark 'N'" on success
- **Unset slot:** "Bookmark 'N' not set" (stays on current line)
- **Slots 0-9 all confirmed working** (Run #20 tested 0, 1, 5, 9 + unset slot 2)
- Bookmarks persist per-session (session restore carries them)

## Keyboard Macros (Run #20 — complex macro confirmed)
- **Record:** Ctrl+P → "Record Macro" → slot digit (0-9) + Enter → "Recording macro 'N' (F5 or Ctrl+P → Stop Recording)"
- **During recording:** All keystrokes are captured LIVE (macro actions are actually applied to the buffer during recording)
- **Stop:** F5 → "Macro 'N' saved (X actions) - F4 → Play Last Macro"
- **Play:** F4 → "Played macro 'N' (X actions)". Plays the LAST recorded macro.
- **Named play:** Ctrl+P → "Play Macro" (if available) to play a specific slot
- **List:** Ctrl+P → "List Macros" → `*Macros*` buffer showing action-level detail per slot
  - Actions shown: SmartHome, InsertChar('X'), MoveDown, MoveUp, etc.
- **Complex macro confirmed working** (Run #20): 5-action macro = Home + "#" + " " + Down + Home. Played on 5 consecutive lines, all received "# " prefix correctly.
- **Slots:** 0-9 (tested slot 3 in Run #20; slots 0-9 in Run #10 earlier)

## Markdown Compose Mode (Run #20 — full verification)
- **Toggle:** Ctrl+P → "Markdown: Toggle Compose/Preview" → prompts "Compose width: None" → press Enter for viewport width
  - Second toggle = OFF
  - Status on ON: "Markdown Compose: ON (soft breaks, centered)"
  - Status: "Markdown compose width: using viewport width" (first activation message)
- **Rendering in compose mode:**
  - `**bold**` → ANSI `[1m` bold attribute; asterisks HIDDEN ✅
  - `*italic*` → ANSI `[3m` italic attribute; asterisks HIDDEN ✅
  - `` `inline code` `` → colored `[38;5;69m`; backticks STRIPPED ✅
  - `# Heading` → heading color `[38;5;51m`; `#` prefix STILL VISIBLE
  - `## Heading` → heading color; `##` STILL VISIBLE
  - ` ```python ... ``` ` code blocks → fence markers STILL VISIBLE; code syntax-highlighted ✅
  - `> blockquote` → `>` colored `[38;5;6m` (teal); quote marker STILL VISIBLE
  - `- lists`, `1. ordered lists`, `---` HR → all visible, normal rendering
- **Line numbers:** HIDDEN in compose mode (no `N │` prefix in display)
- **Editing inside code blocks works in compose mode** — new lines added correctly; display updates immediately
- **Toggle workflow quirk:** First Ctrl+P → "Toggle" activation shows a "Compose width" prompt. Second activation (same command) DIRECTLY toggles ON (no prompt). Third activation toggles OFF.
