# Fresh TUI Editor — Test Plan

> **Process:** Read `AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` first. Filing standards, the
> pre-testing checklist, and the anti-drift rules (R1–R4) live there. In
> particular: **R1 — do not re-verify `[x]` sprints; R2 — advance a `[ ]` item
> every run.** Sprints 1–9 are DONE; work the priority order below, not them.

## RUN #23+ PRIORITY ORDER (coverage-first; work top-down)

> **Run #17 directive (permanent):** Focus on NEW coverage. Increase % of product tested. Avoid re-testing old passing features unless a bug was just fixed.
> **Build directive (Run #22):** Always build from **origin/master** — the state branch is frozen at v0.3.8.

1. ~~**Workspace Trust deep-dive**~~ — **DONE (Run #23).** Full 3-state matrix mapped: Restricted (git+ripgrep allowed, LSP gated off) / Block All (all processes denied: "workspace trust is set to Blocked — no processes may run"; git blame + live grep both blocked) / Trusted (clangd-lsp plugin ungated; actual start still governed by `auto_start`). Block All also restarts editor but preserves file. Only one palette command ("Workspace Trust…"); no direct block/restrict commands. #2291 CONFIRMED FIXED (file survives restart). UX note → IMP-015.
2. ~~**Orchestrator Dock (0.3.12)**~~ — **DONE (Run #24, PASS).** Alt+O dock; arrow live-switch (no restart, bidirectional); view card↔compact; project dropdown; `/` filter; Manage→full dialog; right-click menu (Visit/Archive/Delete) + Archive confirmation; New Session dialog ALL 4 types (Local/SSH/k8s/Devcontainer) with auto-detect + per-type reflow; Local worktree session created. No bugs. Avoided a false positive on keyboard Create-Session (works; was measurement error). Details → learning_db "Orchestrator Dock (Run #24)".
3. ~~**Go to LSP Symbol (0.3.12)**~~ — **DONE (Run #25).** Document-symbol finder via clangd: palette "Go to LSP Symbol" (`lsp_navigation`); lists current-file symbols with kind tags `[class]/[field]/[var]/[fn]` + source-line preview; live substring filter; **live preview** (editor scrolls + highlights selected symbol, blue list row `48;5;25m` / yellow name `38;5;226m`); arrow nav; Enter jumps (cursor lands correctly); Escape restores pre-open position; DOCUMENT-scoped only (helpers.c symbols absent → "No matches", matches its description). **NEW BUG #2301** (low-sev): status bar `Ln` stale after Enter-jump (only `Col` updates; corrects on next move; feature-specific — F12/Ctrl+G fine). Details → learning_db "Go to LSP Symbol (Run #25)".
4. **#2197 pyright recheck** — still open; labeled in-progress/progress. Re-test when a fix lands (pyright + pyright-langserver already on PATH in this container). Run #29: NO fix landed (issue last updated 2026-06-07), skipped per directive.
4b. ~~**`editor.auto_read_only` config option (new, commit 9738ac661)**~~ — **DONE (Run #29). NEW BUG #2309 filed.** Feature itself PASSES all cases: default(true) → library path `/usr/include/stdio.h` auto read-only ("Editing disabled"); `auto_read_only:false` → same library file becomes editable; binary file stays read-only regardless (`[BIN]` tag, edit blocked) per docs edge case; palette "Toggle Read-Only Mode" overrides per-buffer (enable/disable both work). **BUG:** the documented `[RO]` status-bar indicator (editing.md:42 + 0.2.18 blog) is NEVER rendered for any read-only buffer — only transient messages + `[BIN]` tag. Filed #2309 (low–med usability). Details → learning_db "auto_read_only / read-only indicator (Run #29)".
5. ~~**Rainbow bracket colorization (0.3.12)**~~ — **DONE (Run #26, PASS).** Depth-based colorization, 6-color cycle `[6,2,3,126,15,27]` repeating; matching open/close pairs share color; works across all bracket types (`()[]{}`) and across the full viewport; 11-deep nesting cycles+mirrors correctly; unbalanced/extra brackets handled gracefully (no cascade mis-color, no crash). On by default, no setting needed. Details → learning_db "Rainbow Brackets (Run #26)".
6. ~~**Open file from diff (0.3.12)**~~ — **DONE (Run #27, PASS).** Review Diff (unified) → Enter on a hunk opens side-by-side `*Diff: <file>*` (OLD(HEAD)/NEW(Working) panes). OLD-pane **Enter** → read-only `*HEAD:<file>*` buffer, cursor lands on correct HEAD line (verified physically). **Alt+o** → working-tree file at line (`Opened calc.py`). Header legend: OLD `[Enter] open this version`, NEW `[Enter/Alt+o] open file`. Feature correct. One related glitch: status bar `Ln/Col` stale (`Ln 1,Col 1`) immediately after the diff-open jump, self-corrects on next keypress — **same family as #2301**, commented there (not re-filed, R3). tmux gotcha: NEW-pane focus via Tab unreliable; use Alt+o.
7. ~~**Terminal tab auto-naming (0.3.12)**~~ — **DONE (Run #26, PASS).** Terminal tabs auto-name as `<foreground process> — <OSC title>`; follows foreground process (bash→python3→reverts to bash on exit) AND OSC title (verified `bash — HELLO-FROM-OSC` after disabling bash PROMPT_COMMAND). On by default (`editor.terminal_auto_title`). Details → learning_db "Terminal Auto-Naming (Run #26)".
8. ~~**Keybinding editor count anomaly**~~ — **DONE (Run #28). ROOT-CAUSED + FILED #2307.** The "866 vs 548" was a real bug: a single "Select Keybinding Map" round-trip (`default→emacs→default`) drops the editor's total from 866→547 and hides ALL plugin bindings (Source[Plugin] 391/866 → 0/547; Keymap 260 unchanged). 100% reproducible, persists across reopens + wait; restart restores 866. Per-map first-load totals are each correct/stable (default 866, emacs 519, macos 600). Plugin bindings still FUNCTION after round-trip (Alt+O works) → editor listing/reporting defect, not functional loss. Details → learning_db "Keybinding Map Switching (Run #28)".
9. ~~SSH scp-style~~ DONE (Run #22, PASS). ~~#2113~~ CLOSED not_planned. ~~Keybinding Delete/Record~~ DONE (Run #22, PASS). ~~Tour~~ DONE (Run #6).

Note: Run #29 COMPLETE. NEW COVERAGE: the brand-new `editor.auto_read_only` option (commit 9738ac661, not yet in CHANGELOG) — full PASS on behavior, but found + FILED **#2309** (read-only buffers render NO `[RO]` status-bar indicator despite editing.md:42 + 0.2.18 blog promising it; only transient `Editing disabled`/`Read-only mode enabled` messages + `[BIN]` tag). Built v0.3.12 from origin/master @ 2dee83697 (master moved past Run #28's 67d0c6e6c — forced-update; new commits: live-diff word-level highlight 2dee83697, auto_read_only 9738ac661, on-save view-keep f099dd5c5, trust-level reset fix 86d58380b, lsp_enabled master switch f4ee3630f). #2197 NOT fixed (skipped). Used pyright-on-PATH availability noted; clangd NOT installed this container. tmux gotcha: palette opens in `>` command mode already — typing `>` again yields `>>` (no results); BSpace once or just type the command name. NEXT untested NEW-coverage candidates (pick top-down, prefer freshest commits): (a) **live-diff word-level intra-line highlight** on low-similarity removed+added pairs (2dee83697) — visual, ANSI-capture on a git repo with a modified line; (b) **`lsp_enabled` global master switch** (f4ee3630f, #1770) — set `lsp_enabled:false`, verify LSP never starts (pyright on PATH; server-start is observable even though #2197 makes requests time out); (c) **on-save view-keep when undoing a format/trim rewrite** (f099dd5c5); (d) **trust-level change resets active session only, not whole editor** (86d58380b) — relates to #2291. Then #4 #2197 (only if fix lands).

Note: Run #28 COMPLETE. Priority #8 **Keybinding editor count anomaly** ROOT-CAUSED and FILED as **#2307**. Built v0.3.12 from origin/master @ 67d0c6e6c (master moved past Run #27's a9069ca6; same version string, recent commits are e2e test fixes). The Run #22 "866 vs 548" is a genuine bug: a single keymap round-trip (`Select Keybinding Map` default→emacs→default) drops the Keybinding Editor's total 866→547 and removes ALL plugin bindings from the list (Source[Plugin] 391/866 → 0/547; Source[Keymap] 260 unchanged). 100% reproducible, persists across reopens + multi-second wait; app restart restores 866. Each map's FIRST load is correct/stable (default 866, emacs 519, macos 600) — defect only on returning to an already-loaded map. Plugin bindings still WORK after round-trip (Alt+O orchestrator dock confirmed) → editor listing/reporting defect, not loss of function. Searched 4 variations, no dup; not in github_issues. NEXT: priority #4 #2197 pyright recheck (ONLY if a fix landed — check issue status first; needs `pip install pyright`). Otherwise pick fresh coverage from Backlog (e.g. Git Blame edge cases, Markdown preview embedded code, Bookmarks all slots already done — prefer untested areas). tmux gotcha: palette key is keymap-dependent (default/macos = Ctrl+P, emacs = M-x); open Keybinding Editor via Edit menu (F10→Right→Up→Enter) to be keymap-independent.

Note: Run #27 COMPLETE. Priority #6 **Open file from a diff** COMPREHENSIVE PASS (real git repo, working-tree diff). Review Diff → Enter opens side-by-side; OLD-pane Enter → read-only HEAD version at correct line; Alt+o → working-tree file. No new bug filed: status-bar line/col is stale one keypress after the diff-open jump — SAME family as open **#2301** (which is NOT LSP-specific), so commented on #2301 rather than re-filing (R3). Binary unchanged (a9069ca6 = v0.3.12) so per R1 skipped open-issue rechecks. NEXT: priority #8 Keybinding editor count anomaly (866 vs 548), then #4 #2197 pyright (only if fix landed). tmux gotcha: side-by-side NEW-pane focus via Tab unreliable — use Alt+o.

Note: Run #26 COMPLETE. TWO new-coverage items advanced, both PASS, no bugs. Priority #5 **Rainbow brackets** COMPREHENSIVE PASS (ANSI capture): depth-driven 6-color cycle, matching pairs share color, all bracket types, 11-deep nesting cycles+mirrors, unbalanced/extra brackets graceful. Priority #7 **Terminal tab auto-naming** PASS: tab = `<fg process> — <OSC title>`; follows fg process (bash→python3→bash) and OSC title (`bash — HELLO-FROM-OSC`); on by default. Built v0.3.12 from origin/master @ a9069ca6. NEXT: priority #6 Open file from diff (Enter in side-by-side/review-diff opens working-tree NEW / read-only HEAD OLD at that line), then #8 Keybinding editor count anomaly (866 vs 548), then #4 #2197 pyright recheck (only if fix landed).

Note: Run #25 COMPLETE. Go to LSP Symbol (priority #3) COMPREHENSIVE PASS with one low-sev bug. clangd 18 on a small C project (auto_start:true + Trusted → clangd auto-launches, inlay hints render). Feature works: kind-tagged document-symbol list, live filter, live preview (editor follows selection), Enter-jump lands cursor correctly, Escape restores pre-open position, document-scoped per its description. **NEW BUG #2301 filed** (status bar `Ln` stale after symbol Enter-jump; col updates; self-corrects on next keypress; F12/Ctrl+G unaffected). NEXT: priority #5 Rainbow bracket colorization (ANSI capture on nested brackets), then #6 Open file from diff (Enter in side-by-side/review-diff opens working-tree/HEAD file), then #7 Terminal tab auto-naming (`editor.terminal_auto_title`). NOTE pre-trust JSON seeding does NOT work (Fresh's workspace-dir encoding ≠ percent-encoding) — just trust via dialog (T+Enter).

Note: Run #24 COMPLETE. Orchestrator Dock (priority #2) COMPREHENSIVE PASS — Alt+O dock, arrow live-switch (no restart), view toggle, project dropdown, `/` filter, Manage→full dialog, right-click menu + Archive confirm, New Session dialog all 4 types, Local worktree session created. NO bugs filed; avoided a false positive on keyboard Create-Session button (verified it works before filing). tmux gotcha logged: use `BTab` not `S-Tab`. NEXT: priority #3 Go to LSP Symbol (clangd 18; `apt-get install clangd` then start via LSP menu, symbol finder w/ live preview), then #5 Rainbow brackets (ANSI capture on nested brackets), then #6 Open file from diff.

Note: Run #23 COMPLETE. Workspace Trust DEEP-DIVE done — 3-state enforcement matrix (Restricted/Block All/Trusted) fully mapped; enforcement works correctly per the dialog's own documented contract. #2291 CONFIRMED FIXED via UI (file survives trust restart; prior interrupted Run #23 already commented). Dialog now has explicit [OK]/[Quit] buttons + per-option enforcement descriptions. No new bug. IMP-015 logged (Blocked-mode tools fail with generic messages, not "blocked by trust"). NEXT: priority #2 Orchestrator Dock (Alt+O), then #3 Go to LSP Symbol (clangd 18 now installed), then #5 Rainbow brackets.

Note: Run #22 COMPLETE. #2165 + #2212 CONFIRMED FIXED in v0.3.12 (comments added). NEW BUG #2291 filed (Workspace Trust restart discards open file + unsaved edits with --no-restore). SSH scp-style END-TO-END PASS (real sshd). #2221 still broken. Keybinding Delete + Record Key Search PASS. #2122 still open. #2113 closed not_planned (retired).

Note: Run #21 COMPLETE. SSH URL-style BUG FOUND (#2221 filed): `ssh://` URI treated as local path; scp-style works correctly. Keybinding editor PASS (add/edit/save/verify all work). Search in selection: NOT IMPLEMENTED (no such toggle in search bar). Multi-root workspaces PASS (workspace scoping correct; cross-workspace files included in search when open). #2165 CONFIRMED STILL OPEN. #2113 NOT REPRODUCED (8 more attempts).

Note: Run #20 COMPLETE. text-actions Decode ALL PASS (Base64/URI/JSON/Hex; NEW decode commands discovered). Bookmarks ALL PASS (Alt+0-9). Keyboard macros PASS (5-action complex macro). Markdown compose PASS (bold/italic ANSI, code blocks with syntax-hl, editing inside blocks). #2212 CONFIRMED STILL OPEN in v0.3.10 (comment added).

Note: Run #19 COMPLETE. Code Actions BUG CONFIRMED + FILED (#2212): empty context.diagnostics always sent. Encoding handling TESTED (PASS — detect/reload/set/save all work). Themes TESTED (all 8 including new 'nord' PASS). Clangd auto-start RESOLVED: `auto_start` setting exists (default false); IMP-013 updated.

Note: Run #18 COMPLETE. clangd LSP TESTED (hover/def/complete/refs/rename all PASS; Code Actions INCONCLUSIVE). text-actions plugin TESTED (install + Base64 encoding PASS). Git Blame multi-commit TESTED (PASS — 'b' depth tracking confirmed). #2122 CONFIRMED still no keybinding. #2165 CONFIRMED still broken.

Note: Run #17 COMPLETE. File Explorer TESTED (PASS), Settings TextList [x] CONFIRMED mouse-only (Delete key = keyboard equivalent), pyright LSP BROKEN (#2197).
Note: Sprint 10 COMPLETE, Sprint 11 COMPLETE, Sprint 12 COMPLETE (TB01/TB02/TB03), Alt+A TESTED (PASS), Calibrate Keyboard TESTED, Block Selection TESTED (PASS Run #15), Flash:Jump TESTED (PASS Run #15), Package Manager TESTED (PASS Run #15+16), Live Diff TESTED (PASS Run #15+16), Live Grep Cycle Provider TESTED (PASS Run #15), Dev Container TESTED (PASS Run #15+16), Git Blame TESTED (PASS Run #16), Orchestrator TESTED (PASS Run #16), Color Highlighter TESTED (PASS Run #16), Review Diff CONFIRMED FIXED (Run #16, 0.3.10).

Note: Sprint 10 COMPLETE (T45/T46/T47/T48 all PASS), Sprint 11 COMPLETE (T28/T30/T37 all PASS), Sprint 12 COMPLETE (TB01/TB02/TB03), Alt+A TESTED (PASS), Calibrate Keyboard wizard TESTED (24 steps/5 groups; does NOT test Ctrl+H).

Everything in "Backlog (Future Runs)" below feeds this order; promote items up
as they're picked.

  - PASS: Find bar at bottom with Case Sensitive/Whole Word/Regex options
- [x] **T22** — Type search query; verify incremental match highlighting
  - PASS: Matches highlighted in yellow (confirmed via ANSI codes)
- [x] **T23** — Navigate matches with F3; verify cursor jumps with "Match N of M"
  - PASS: F3 = next match, Shift+F3 = prev. Status shows "Match N of M". Wrap-around works.

- [x] **T28** — Go to bracket/matching bracket; verify jump
  - PASS (Run #13): Command "Go to Matching Bracket" (Ctrl+]) works via command palette. '(' → ')' and '{' → '}' jumps confirmed. NOTE: Ctrl+] via tmux send-keys is unreliable (Ctrl+] = 0x1D, may not transmit correctly in tmux). Use command palette instead.
- [x] **T29** — Word movement (Ctrl+Left/Right); verify word-by-word nav
  - PASS: Ctrl+Right jumps to end of each word/token
- [x] **T30** — Position history (Alt+Left/Right); verify back/forward nav
  - PASS (Run #13): Alt+Left goes back in position history; Alt+Right goes forward. Tested with Ctrl+G jumps building history.

- [x] **T37** — Toggle line wrap; verify wrap behavior
  - PASS (Run #13): View menu → ☑ Line Wrap toggles. OFF = long line on 1 row (truncated). ON = long line wraps to multiple rows. Toggle is bidirectional.
- [x] **T38** — Switch theme (Select Theme → dracula); verify color changes
  - PASS: Theme picker shows dark/dracula/high-contrast/light/nostalgia/solarized-dark/terminal
  - PASS: Dracula theme applied; confirmed via ANSI color code changes
  - BONUS: File Explorer (Ctrl+B) opens directory sidebar — tested and confirmed

## Sprint 8: Tabs & Buffers
- [x] **T39** — Open multiple files; verify tabs appear
  - PASS: Multiple tabs visible simultaneously (tested with 4+ tabs)
- [x] **T40** — Click between tabs; verify buffer switch
  - PASS: Ctrl+PgDn/PgUp navigates between tabs
- [x] **T41** — Close one tab; verify others remain
  - PASS: Alt+W or "Close Tab" command closes individual tabs

## Sprint 9: Integrated Terminal
- [x] **T42** — Open terminal (via "Open Terminal in Utility Dock" Alt+`); verify terminal panel appears

## Sprint 10: Edge Cases & Stress
- [x] **T45** — Open a large file; verify performance
  - PASS (Run #13): 49MB / 500K line file opened instantly. Navigation to end: immediate. Search "499999" found 2 matches in <2s. Gutter shows BYTE OFFSETS (not line numbers) for large files — Fresh's virtual view mode.
- [x] **T46** — Open a binary file; verify graceful handling
  - PASS (Run #13): /bin/ls opened gracefully. Tab shows [BIN] tag. Non-printable bytes shown as <XX> hex notation. No crash/freeze.
- [x] **T47** — Rapid keystrokes; verify no dropped input
  - PASS (Run #14): 50 rapid chars → all intact; 20 rapid Ctrl+Z → all undone correctly. No dropped input, no corruption.
- [x] **T48** — Resize tmux window while editing; verify layout reflow
  - PASS (Run #14): Resize 220×50 → 80×24 → 180×40 all reflow correctly. Status bar truncates gracefully at narrow width. Editor remains responsive. Resize mid-typing (100×30 → 160×45 during text entry) produced no corruption.

---

## Sprint 15: Plugin Features + Bug Rechecks — COMPLETED (Run #15)
- [x] ***Keyboard Shortcuts* 'q' recheck** — STILL BROKEN. "Editing disabled in this buffer" (#2125 related, still open)
- [x] **#2117 Review Diff discard hunk recheck** — STILL BROKEN. "Patch failed" error persists; manual git apply --reverse works fine (Fresh's internal apply is broken)
- [x] **Flash: Jump plugin** — PASS: Hint overlay activates; pressing hint character jumps cursor to target position
- [x] **Package Manager: Packages** — PASS: 13 packages listed, search filter works, category tabs work, detail panel shows install button
- [x] **Package Manager: Install from URL** — PASS: "Git URL or local path:" prompt appears
- [x] **Live Diff: vs HEAD** — PASS: Green `│` gutter markers on added lines, status bar confirms mode
- [x] **Live Diff: vs Disk** — PASS: `+` marker on unsaved buffer content, status bar confirms mode
- [x] **Live Diff: vs Branch...** — PASS: Branch prompt with "main" pre-filled, status "comparing against main"
- [x] **Live Grep: Cycle Provider** — PASS: Alt+P cycles git-grep → rg → grep; all providers work
- [x] **Block selection (Alt+Shift+Arrow)** — PASS: M-S-Down/M-S-Right work in this build (rectangular selection confirmed by typing test)
- [x] **Dev Container: Create Config** — PASS: Creates .devcontainer/devcontainer.json with Ubuntu template
- [x] **Dev Container: Show Info** — PASS: Shows config with action buttons; q closes correctly
- [x] **Dev Container: Show Features** — PASS: "No features configured" message
- [x] **Dev Container: Show Forwarded Ports** — PASS: Panel with "No configured or runtime ports" + q close

## Sprint 13: Alt+A + Calibrate Keyboard + Bug Rechecks — COMPLETED (Run #14)
- [x] **T47** — PASS: Rapid keystrokes, no dropped input (50 chars burst, 20 rapid undos)
- [x] **T48** — PASS: Resize reflow works (220×50 ↔ 80×24 ↔ 180×40; mid-type resize safe)
- [x] **Alt+A** — PASS: Project-wide Search & Replace works: 9 matches/4 files, file scoping via Space, Replace All with confirmation dialog, status "Replaced 3 occurrences in 1 files"
- [x] **Calibrate Keyboard wizard** — TESTED: 24 steps/5 groups (Basic Editing, Line Navigation, Word Navigation, Document Navigation, Emacs-Style). Does NOT test Ctrl+H. s/b/g/a controls all work.
- [x] **#2125 partial** — Diagnostics panel 'q' CONFIRMED FIXED (commit 89caf72). *Keyboard Shortcuts* 'q' STILL BROKEN.
- [x] **#2112** — CONFIRMED FIXED (commit b7e7e64). Search/Replace panel now finds matches in /tmp files outside workspace root.

## Sprint 12: Bug Verification — COMPLETED (Run #13)
- [x] **TB01** — CONFIRMED: Keyboard Shortcuts buffer 'q' does not close
  - Same root cause as #2125 (Diagnostics panel). Comment added to #2125. Do NOT re-file.
- [x] **TB02** — CONFIRMED: Edit menu "Replace..." maps to Ctrl+Alt+R = Query Replace (interactive), not basic Replace (Ctrl+R)
  - Filed as new issue #2135. Do NOT re-file.
- [x] **TB03** — RESOLVED (NOT A BUG): Alt+W correctly closes tab in normal editing mode. Status shows "Tab closed".
  - Context-sensitive: Alt+W in search bar = toggle whole word; outside search = close tab. Expected behavior.
