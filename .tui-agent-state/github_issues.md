## Open Issues (agent-filed)

| # | Title | Filed | Status | Notes for next run |
|---|-------|-------|--------|-------------------|
| [#2109](https://github.com/sinelaw/fresh/issues/2109) | Ctrl+H doesn't open Find & Replace in terminals (Ctrl+H = Backspace) | Run #1 | **Open** | Terminal sends `0x08`. Verify whether Calibrate Keyboard wizard detects it. Do NOT re-file. |
| [#2111](https://github.com/sinelaw/fresh/issues/2111) | Search: F3 does not navigate to next match while search bar is open | Run #1 | **Open** | Confirmed usability bug: F3 silently ignored while search bar is open. Contradicts VS Code/Sublime/browser behavior. Issue updated with clear expected vs actual. Do NOT re-file. |
| [#2112](https://github.com/sinelaw/fresh/issues/2112) | Search/Replace panel: "No matches found" for files opened outside project workspace | Run #2 | **FIXED** (Run #14) | Fixed by commit b7e7e64. Confirmed fixed in Run #14: /tmp files now appear in Search/Replace panel results. Comment added. |
| [#2113](https://github.com/sinelaw/fresh/issues/2113) | Command palette: keystrokes typed in fuzzy file mode can leak into editor buffer | Run #2 | **Open** | Race condition during `>command` → file mode transition via BSpace. Timing-sensitive. Reproduced once. Do NOT re-file. |
| [#2117](https://github.com/sinelaw/fresh/issues/2117) | Review Diff: "Discard hunk" fails with "patch does not apply" even when patch is valid | Run #5 | **FIXED** (Run #16) | Closed by maintainer. Confirmed fixed in 0.3.10 (Run #16): review_diff_test16.txt +4 lines → discard → "Review Diff: 0 hunks". File reverted to original. Do NOT re-file. |
| [#2125](https://github.com/sinelaw/fresh/issues/2125) | Diagnostics panel keyboard shortcuts (q: close, a: toggle filter, RET: goto) do not work | Run #9 | **CLOSED** (Run #16) | Closed by maintainer. Diagnostics panel 'q' confirmed still fixed in 0.3.10. *Keyboard Shortcuts* 'q' still broken → filed new #2165. Do NOT re-file. |
| [#2135](https://github.com/sinelaw/fresh/issues/2135) | Edit menu "Replace..." label maps to Ctrl+Alt+R (Query Replace), not basic Replace (Ctrl+R) | Run #13 | **Open** | Filed Run #13. Do NOT re-file. |

## Closed Issues (agent-filed — do NOT re-open or re-file)

| # | Title | Filed | Why Closed |
|---|-------|-------|-----------|
| [#2108](https://github.com/sinelaw/fresh/issues/2108) | Revert command fails when buffer has unsaved modifications | Run #1 | **False positive.** We triggered "Reload with Encoding..." not "Revert". `File > Revert` works correctly — shows `(r)evert/(c)ancel` prompt. |
| [#2110](https://github.com/sinelaw/fresh/issues/2110) | File opens as modified after session restore | Run #1 | **By design.** This is hot exit (`hot_exit` config, default on). Documented in `docs/features/session-persistence.md`. |

## Topics Already Investigated — Do Not Re-file

Even if the symptom looks fresh, these have already been fully investigated:

| Symptom | Conclusion | Issue |
|---------|------------|-------|
| `File > Revert` shows "Cannot reload" error | Wrong menu — that's "Reload with Encoding..." | #2108 closed |
| File opens with `[+]` / `*` on fresh launch | Hot exit restoring previous session | #2110 closed |
| `Ctrl+H` deletes a word | Terminal compat: `0x08` = Backspace | #2109 open |
| F3 does nothing during active search | F3 silently ignored while search bar is open; Enter closes bar first, then F3 works | #2111 open |
| Search/Replace panel returns "No matches found" for /tmp file | FIXED in b7e7e64. /tmp files now found via explicit queuing of out-of-root buffers. | #2112 fixed |
| Characters from command palette file search appear in editor buffer | Focus race condition during `>` → file mode transition | #2113 open |
| Review Diff `d` discard shows "Patch failed: error: patch failed" | Fresh's internal patch application is broken; manual `git apply --reverse` works | #2117 open |
| Pressing `q` in `*Keyboard Shortcuts*` buffer shows "Editing disabled" | Same root cause as #2125 — `[RO]` special buffers don't handle single-key shortcuts | #2125 open (comment added) |
| Edit menu "Replace..." shortcut is Ctrl+Alt+R (Query Replace), not Ctrl+R | Label mismatch — filed as new issue | #2135 open |

## How to Use This File Before Filing

1. Describe the symptom you observed in one sentence.
2. Scan the "Topics Already Investigated" table above for a match.
3. Scan the open issues table — if your topic is there, add a comment to the existing issue rather than opening a new one.
4. Search GitHub with at least 3 different query variations.
5. Only then open a new issue and add a row to this file.

## Issue #2165 — *Keyboard Shortcuts* buffer 'q' does not close (persists in 0.3.10)
- **Filed:** Run #16, 2026-05-31
- **URL:** https://github.com/sinelaw/fresh/issues/2165
- **Label:** bug, tui-agent-auto-bug
- **Status:** Open
- **Summary:** The `*Keyboard Shortcuts*` buffer opened via `Shift+F1` documents "Press 'q' to close this buffer." on line 4, but pressing 'q' shows "Editing disabled in this buffer" in 0.3.10. All other special buffers (Diagnostics, Git Blame, Dev Container) correctly handle 'q'. The Diagnostics panel fix in commit 89caf72 used `panelKeys` for that plugin — this buffer uses a different mechanism that was not updated. Parent issue #2125 closed without fixing this.
- **Search queries used:** `keyboard shortcuts q editing disabled`, `keyboard shortcuts buffer close`, `Shift+F1 q close`

## Issue #2122 — move_to_paragraph_down/up Has No Default Keybinding (0.3.9 oversight)
- **Filed:** Run #7, 2026-05-26
- **URL:** https://github.com/sinelaw/fresh/issues/2122
- **Label:** bug, tui-agent-auto-bug
- **Status:** Open
- **Summary:** The `move_to_paragraph_down` and `move_to_paragraph_up` actions added in 0.3.9 (PR #2084) have no default keybinding and are not accessible from the command palette. The sibling `select_to_paragraph_*` actions have `Ctrl+Shift+↓/↑` bindings. Users cannot use the new "jump to paragraph" feature without manually binding it.
- **Search queries used:** `move_to_paragraph keybinding`, `paragraph navigation keybinding`, `paragraph action command palette missing`
